  <i>Intention</i>: In honor of my 1 Year Anniversary at PayPal and getting to experience what it's
  like working in the "real world" after college, I wanted to take a moment and outline 12 key
  insights that I've gathered while working. While these key insights are applicable for everyone,
  I'm finding that it's also just as important to a share each personal moment that sparked each
  insight. I'm a huge proponent of bringing all of yourself to work because there's so many
  different experiences that we can each pull from to bring creativity and many different schools of
  thought.

<br />

### 1. Ask questions. Lots of them.

  <span>
    Whenever a student has asked me what it's like to work on a team of software engineers, I
    mention that each engineer that I've had the pleasure of working with is always super helpful
    and that with any question you have, if they don't have the answer, they'll find someone who
    does. I got to experience this during my internship and when I started working, I worked on a
    front-end team the first half of the year (July to December '19) that was mainly remote and am
    currently working in a co-located back-end team starting in January. With the remote team, I was
    comfortable asking questions via Slack. With the co-located team, over time I became more
    comfortable asking questions in-person. Having to ask questions in person pushed me out of my
    comfort zone and with the assurance of the team. they reinforced the idea that no question is a
    dumb question.

### 2. Create a habit of continuous learning.

  />
  <span>
    During the first half of the year, I was on the Credit User Experience team working in
    Javascript (React and Node). Despite having previous internship experience in full stack
    engineering, there were still a lot of different tools that I needed to learn such as GraphQL,
    Jenkins, and Jest. I'm fortunate that PayPal has a partnership with LinkedIn Learning, Udemy,
    and O'Reilly Safari. These partnerships allowed me to dive into the plethora of resources
    offered and indulge in my curiosity of learning how all of these tools work with each other.

### 3. Take a moment to acknowledge whomever you walk by in the office.

  />
  <span>
    It can be as simple as "Hi" or a "Hey Joe!" This is a great opportunity to strike up a
    conversation and even learn more about the different areas within your work. A moment that
    stands out in memory is when I said Hi to an employee who works on the Issuance team and is the
    main leader of the Chinese community in our Scottsdale (SCF) office. Through that conversation,
    I was able to get connected with the SCF Chinese community and take part in setting up the fun
    Chinese New Year event. During the event, I even got to lead a fun site activity which involved
    transferring marshmallows, cheerios, and M&Ms from one bowl to another.{' '}

### 4. Build confidence by taking a public speaking course.

<div>

  />
  <span>
    When there's numerous new things to learn and master, I found myself being less confident the
    more that I didn't know. During the first month, I saw my teammate reading a book titled, "How
    to Win Friends and Influence People". I asked him what the book was about and he mentioned that
    he was taking the{' '}
    <a href="https://www.iamcngai.com/blogs/from-concept-to-communication">Dale Carnegie</a> course
    to improve his public speaking and leadership skills. I thought this was a great opportunity and
    signed up for the next session which ran from October to December '19. I read in
    <i>The Quick & Easiest Way to Effective Speaking</i> book that <b>
      no one can tell your story better than you
    </b>. This along with the support that the class exuded gave me that extra boost of confidence that
    I needed in order to share different aspects of my life ranging from a defining moment to a person
    whoâ€™s inspired me and has shaped me into who I am today. As a cohort, we all became closer as we
    connected with one and other each session. With all of the fascinating and unique tales that were
    shared, I realized that when given the space, everyone has an inspiring story to share.{' '}

### 5. Provide suggestions when the moment strikes.

  />
  <span>
    With the Credit services that my team supports, we have dedicated Live Support team member who
    answers questions that may come up in our help channels, triages 4xx and 5xx HTTP status errors
    that were returned either from our service or any downstream services, and handles other
    miscellaneous tasks that may come up during the sprint. Being a part of the Live Support
    rotation was one of the goals that my manager and I had set for the beginning of the year. My
    opportunity came when a teammate who was going to be next on the rotation was taking time off
    and there were only two other teammates who have been in rotation. Being on Live Support exposed
    me to other components that interact with ours as well as providing suggestions and solutions
    for triaging.{' '}

### 6. Take the initiative.

  />
  <span>
    PayPal has an RCG program for Recent College Graduates where you get to take part in fun events
    and dinners organized by the RCG Committee. One of my teammates was on the committee and asked
    me to attend on his behalf an RCG Meetup that discussed organizing activities such as{' '}
    <i>1:1 RCG Coffee Hangouts</i>, board game hour, and more. I used to organize and host birthday
    parties and dance team hangouts and saw this as an opportunity to continue developing my
    organizational skills. I also got join in on the <i>1:1 RCG Coffee Hangouts</i> and get to know
    a couple of RCGs in San Jose before finally meeting them in person during the{' '}
    <a href="https://www.iamcngai.com/blogs/paypal-rcg-upload">RCG summit</a> in November '19. These
    moments inspired me to join the Scottsdale RCG Committee and become a mentor for the future
    RCGs. In addition, I also got to share my RCG journey at the RCG Ask Me Anything event in July
    '20 for students who interested in joining PayPal.

### 7. Soak in both the positive and constructive feedback.

  />
  <span>
    Between the code reviews and 1:1s with my manager, I've received a lot of positive feedback as
    well as constructive feedback. Naturally, I wanted to continue improving and so I only focused
    on the constructive feedback. In my free time, I took a dance class from an instructor who
    encouraged us to take in the positive feedback and celebrate these small moments rather than
    only look for the constructive feedback. I found this mental management tip to be quite helpful
    and gave equal value to the small moments where I did something that can be repeated
    beneficially.

### 8. Find ways to give back to the community.

  />
  <span>
    Paypal encourages us to take the time to volunteer and give back to our community. In September
    '19, PayPal hosted a <i>PayPal Day at ASU</i> where students got to listen to RCGs speak about
    their experience and technical talks as well as speak with PayPal employees regarding
    internships and full-time jobs. Since I had done an internship and capstone with PayPal and am
    currently an RCG, I thought this was a great way to give back to the community and share about
    my internship and RCG journey. After getting to speak with over a hundred students and hear how
    they got to where they are today, that day became a full circle moment for me that left me
    feeling grateful to work at PayPal.

### 9. Integrate interdisciplinary thinking.

<div>

  <span>
    For exercise, I enjoy taking dance classes in the style of Contemporary and Street Jazz. Lately,
    I've been taking dance classes for commercial and film that have the class structure of a warm
    up, learning 45 seconds to 1 min of choreography, and then a videographer films groups or solos
    dancing the choreography. This class structure simulates a dance audition where you would learn
    choreography and then audition in groups. With filming and auditions, there's the pressure of
    performing the choreography and not messing up. During quarantine, I've gotten the opportunity
    to learn remotely from instructors world-wide. I took a class from <i>Broadway Dance Center</i>
    instructor and he gave us this mental management tip: "Fear disjoints how you learn. When you're
    picturing someone else you admire getting the job, the fear manifests and you miss picturing yourself
    getting the job." I can apply this tip in my job in the sense that when encountering an unknown issue
    or software bug, instead of letting fear manifest, I can picture myself finding a solution. There
    is also another saying in dance that "every day is an audition" because you never know when the opportunity
    will present itself. I also apply this saying to my work as a means of building a strong work ethic.
    One can never be prepared enough and even though we may make mistakes, we can grow from them.

### 10. Seek ways to take on more responsibility.

<div>
  <img align="right" src="/images/12months/Internship Summit 2018.jpg" />
  <span>
    As I've gotten to talk with more students who are seeking internships and full-time offers, I've
    carved out the time to hold 30 min 1:1s and share what it's like to work at PayPal. I'm
    fascinated by each person's story and want to help them in any way that I can to further their
    journey. Due to the pandemic, internships at PayPal were held remotely. The University Programs
    team came up with an <i>RCG-Intern Buddy</i> program so that the interns can have another point
    of contact for any questions regarding PayPal, post-college, etc. I signed up to be a
    buddy/mentor to two interns and throughout this program. I've realized that there's so much that
    we can learn from each other.
  </span>
  <br />
  <span>
    While I've also had the opportunity to share my journey, I've found my 1:1s with leaders just as
    beneficial. For example, in a 1:1 with my manager, she mentioned that if there isn't an
    opportunity, she will go out of her way to create one. I found this very empowering because it
    shows just how much my manager gives into cultivating my growth at PayPal.
  </span>
</div>
<br />

### 11. Lead with gratitude.

<div>
  <img align="right" src="/images/12months/DarthCredit18.png" />
  <span>
    During my morning commute, one of the podcasts that I listen to is{' '}
    <a href="https://awesomeatyourjob.com/podcast/">How to Be Awesome at Your Job</a>. One of the
    episodes was on what qualities make a Peer to Peer leader. The quality that stuck out to me is
    "leading with gratitude" because it's something that we can all do that doesn't require being in
    a position of authority. By taking the time to thank my teammates for their help debugging and
    answering any questions that I've come up with, we've built a positive and stronger rapport
    among the team. In addition, the act of sincere gratitude has even become more common in our
    daily standup meetings and retros.
  </span>
</div>
<br />

### 12. Each person's experience and journey is unique.

<div>
  <img align="right" src="/images/12months/NY_Hudson_Yards.png" />
  <span>
    Your journey has as much value as your peer's journey. A specific moment that I'd like to
    highlight is the time that a teammate and I created an acrostic containing the 35 names of the
    people in Scottsdale Consumer Credit organization. The acrostic started out with the phrase
    "It's going to be ok, Joe" (this was a running theme that I started during my internship) and
    then we added all of the names stemming from "Joe". This was a simple yet fun, creative activity
    that showed just how diverse the organization is. I was even nick-named the "Chief Culture
    Officer" which I take to heart.

## TLDR

<span>
  As a wrap-up, these 12 key insights have increased my awareness to several different perspectives
  and made me realize that we can each make a huge impact in the constant state of learning. With
  outlining a specific moment for each insight, it's been a fun way to take a trip down memory lane
  as well as think about how much we can all grow in just 12 months. With that, I appreciate you
  taking the time to read and hope that you benefit from these insights as well!
