    <i>Intention</i>: I wanted to take a moment to reflect on my creative process and articulate the
    improvisational movement around my work, I'll Meet You Where You're At, presented at Third Space
    Dance Festival at Tempe Center For the Arts on June 28-29, 2023.

  <br />
  <span>
    <b>Third Space Dance Festival</b>: The inaugural Third Space Dance Festival presents
    professional concert dance performance work from local professional dance artists and
    choreographers. The live performance pieces represent the quality and diversity of artistry and
    talent in Arizona, specifically the Phoenix Valley. The program will feature an immersive
    performance work that will take place in the lobby followed by a main-stage program. The program
    features a diversity of aesthetic, style, and artistic approach, bringing the community new and
    innovative performance work by local professionals.

### The Concept

<span>
  <img align="right" height="525px" width="316px" src="/images/IMYWYA/ThirdSpaceTCA05.png" />
  <blockquote>
    “I’ll Meet You Where You’re At” is a structured improvisational/choreography piece that includes
    "You Don't Know Me But You Will" (a piece performed by the artist in 2018 which was inspired by
    the concept of first impressions) and then further explores our expectations versus the reality
    of who we meet now with an additional factor, digital. This piece explores the question, how do
    you develop trust with someone and find commonalities when you haven’t met them in person?
  </blockquote>
  Due to the fact that I hadn't performed since February 2020, I didn't have any current work in
  videos that I could share as my proof of concept. Since I wanted the adjudicators to see what my
  capabilities are, I decided to take 2 mins from one of my past pieces, "You Don't Know Me But You
  Will", and add 2 other sections to create a 4 min piece.
</span>
<br />

### Structured improvisation as a performance

<span>
  A question that I often get is, "How do you perform structured improvisation?". I found myself
  creating a mind map of what I envisioned for the three sections based off of movement motifs, the
  music, the lighting/moood, and points in time that evoked emotion. This allowed me to visualize
  what the piece meant to me and also consider the audience's interpretations. As a choreographic
  intention, I definitely didn't want the piece to have literal gestures or phrases in the music.
  Instead, my goal was to allow the audience to connect to it based on their own experiences.

### Challenges

#### Choices

<span>
  One thing that I found myself struggling with is being comfortable with the choices that I'm
  making in my improvisation. In the past couple of years, I've taken more Advanced choreography
  classes that consist of popping, house footwork, and hip hop basics. In those classes, the
  teachers have pushed for finding a connection to the music and making choices such as adding your
  own arms to the footwork that feel natural to you. The resolution I found is that it's ok to add
  these non-concert styles into my own work because ultimately, it's my movement and I have the
  freedom to choose how I want to move.
</span>
<br />

#### Identities

<span>
  Another thing that I found myself struggling with is how do I make sense of all of these external
  identities such as being an Asian American, a Software Engineer (where there's less women in STEM
  careers), a Dance Artist, and even the CEO of{' '}
  <a href="https://justplatypost.com/">justplatypost</a> when I see all of these as being "me".
  There's moments where I definitely find myself showing up as only a Software Engineer or Dance
  Artist when really my thoughts consist of mix of art and logic.
</span>
<br />

### Music

<span>
  <img align="right" height="525px" width="325px" src="/images/IMYWYA/ThirdSpaceTCA01.png" />
  <b>Nym by Phlux</b>
  <br />
  The first section is Nym by Phlux. This was the same music that I used for my past piece. In a weird
  way, it felt like I was listening to this song for the first time because my ear for musicality has
  improved. I also had more footwork in my vocabulary so I was able to pull out different rhythms in
  the music. My knowledge of my body has also improved which allowed me to make bigger pops. I referenced
  the same motifs such as the handshake, creating a secret handshake, the "bro" handshake, and the nervousness
  felt when you're meeting someone new. I think because I have more control over my body now with experience,
  I was able to refine the movement and not look as tight as I did back in 2018.
  <br />
  <br />
  <b>Voicemail from Mainland China</b>
  <br />
  In November 2022, I got a voicemail from Mainland China saying that I received a package but no
  one was there to sign for it. The caller mentioned this in Mandarin, English, and then Mandarin
  again. There was also a classical music playing in the background which gave a slightly eery and
  distorted feel. I just knew I had to use it in this piece.
  <br />
  <br />
  <b>Growth</b>
  <br />
  For the third section, I struggled for a good 2 months because I wanted to compose the music myself.
  A mentor gave me the great advice of seeing what sounds right. My interpretation of being free and
  expansive will be different than someone else's. A mentee gave me the great advice of turning to what
  I already have as samples. Using both advice, I ended up using sound samples that I took from my Europe
  trip where I went to CERN in Geneva, Tekniska Museek in Stockholm, and the Mozart Museum in Vienna.
  During that time, I was truly inspired by all of the different sounds and the feeling like I could
  try and do anything.
  <br />
  <br />
  <b>Connecting all of the sections</b>
  <br />A challenge that I came across was how to link all of these three sections together so that the
  transition was seamless. I had watched the show B_TTERLAND by Bo Park and <a href="https://www.shinsathecollective.com/">
    SHINSA The Collective
  </a> and was inspired by the use of film projector clicks to change between pieces. I was inspired
  and incorporated this into my piece as well. I also added samples of the film projector running in
  the background as a way to create white noise so there wasn't extreme silence.

### The Costume

<div>
  <img align="right" height="525px" width="325px" src="/images/IMYWYA/ThirdSpaceTCA03.png" />

<span>
  In my 2018 piece, I wore a "Hello my name is" black tshirt and red jeggings. As both fashion had
  changed and what clothes I wear while taking class has changed, I wanted to create an updated
  outfit that made me feel comfortable to wear and move in. For the shirt, I was inspired by
  watching Next in Fashion so I took a Hello my name is SVG, rotated it 15 degrees and expanded it
  so it would cover the whole shirt. I used Printify to make this custom shirt. For the pants, I
  went with burgundy{' '}
  <a href="https://shop.lululemon.com/p/womens-joggers/Align-Jogger/_/prod9200027?color=0001">
    Align joggers
  </a>{' '}
  from Lululemon to add extra movement to my grooves. I also wore generic black socks as I feel like
  this creates a cleaner line and allows me t turn and slide across the stage easier.

### Tech and Dress Rehearsal

<span>
  Back in college, I had a friend who would do the lighting for my pieces and she did an amazing
  job! This time around, it was up to me to create the lighting and overall, this was a great
  learning experience for me! Thankfully, we had both a Lighting Designer and Stage Manager who were
  able to take the lighting ideas that I had and make them come to life! All that I had to do on my
  side was note the timestamps of when I wanted the cues and the mood(s) that I was going for.
  Typically, you can also have certain moves be the lighting cues but since this was improvisation,
  I had the timestamps be the cues. This process turned out to be really painless and I also had one
  friend who stood on the stage while we were setting the lighting and another friend to film my
  mark-through.

<br />
<span>
  For the dress rehearsal, I was actually more nervous because I had this run-through filmed by my
  family so I could share it with friends and coworkers who lived abroad. I did my usual preparation
  of warming up for 30 mins, improvising to different songs for 10-15 mins, and then listening and
  running through of the piece. Overall, I was extremely happy with the run-through because it was a
  mix of what I had intended, feeling the energy of being back on stage, and making new discoveries
  around different grooves that I could do when listening intently to the sound score.

<br />

### Show Day #1

<span>
  <img align="right" height="481px" width="435px" src="/images/IMYWYA/ThirdSpaceProgram.png" />
  The show started at 7:30 so I arrived at Tempe Center For the Arts at 5:30. This gave me time to get
  into the zone and a lot of time to warm up my body. Between 6:00-6:45, I warmed up on the side of the
  stage as there was also a warmup being held on the stage for all of the performers. I prefer to do
  my own warm up since there's a wide vocabulary that I could perform depending on what I feel like in
  the moment. My warmup consists of ballet barre (pliés, degagés, rond de jambes, and developpés) and
  improvisation to different songs ranging from R&B to Pop. This helped me get into what emotions and
  feelings did I want to convey to the audience tonight.
  <br />I felt that with this performance, I had good control of my body. For example, I do a tilt
  and was able to pull up onto relevé as a transition into the next move. I also played with sliding
  and doing expansive movement.
  <br />
  <br />
  <b>Artists Talk back </b>
  <br />
  We had a Q&A session after the performance as way to get insight as to how the audience received our
  work and what did that evoke in them.
  <br />
  <br />
  <blockquote>
    <i>
      Did you intend for the audience to interpret your piece how you intended or leave it open to
      interpretation?
    </i>
  </blockquote>
  With artwork, I prefer to read a synopsis before looking at the art to better understand the artist's
  intentions and have a foundation to work off of. I applied the same preference to this piece where
  I had the synopsis in the program yet both the music and movement were so literal to the point where
  it's black and white.
  <br />
  <br />
  <blockquote>
    <i>Did you find yourself getting into a zone when you're performing?</i>
  </blockquote>
  When I improvise, I feel the most present in both my body and in time. There's also the flow state
  I reach where I blink out and can't remember what I did. I feel like I tend to reach this state each
  time I'm improvising.
  <br />
</span>
<br />

### Show Day #2

<span>
  <img align="right" height="525px" width="314px" src="/images/IMYWYA/ThirdSpaceTCA04.png" />
  After my usual warmup on stage, I decided to focus on what would I try differently for this performance.
  One thing I thought of is making a conscious choice to transition the opposite way out of moves than
  I would do naturally. For example, if I lift my leg and turn out of it, my natural tendency is to turn
  inward so then I would turn away from my lifted leg. I wanted to keep things interesting because this
  was an opportunity to stretch my creativity.
  <br />I felt that with this performance, I had better control of my body than I did the previous
  night. I was able to turn and pause at the end with a leg lifted or hold the ending position
  before going into the next movement.
  <br /> After the performance, I received really good feedback. One person was inspired by how I combined
  contemporary and hip hop footwork as they were looking to do that in their artistry. Another person
  appreciated my attention to musicality and how I matched my movement with the music. Someone also came
  up to me and thanked me for the impact that my work made on them. They truly felt my piece which was
  heartwarming to hear.
</span>
<br />

### That's a wrap!

<div>
  <span>
    Upon reflection of this piece, I am extremely blessed and grateful to have had the opportunity
    to present I'll Meet You Where You're At at Third Space Dance Festival at Tempe Center For the
    Arts. I'm also thankful for my family and friends who came to support. What started out as a
    choice to maintain my relevancy as a dance artist turned it a season of self-discovery and
    growth as both an artist and perfomer.
