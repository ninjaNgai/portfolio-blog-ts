<span>
  Imagine that you’re in a room of 10 people and a leader. The leader asks, “How can we combine
  Dance and Software Engineering?” While others are providing their input, you start to come up with
  an idea. You’re about to say it and then you freeze.
</span>
<br />
<i>What if I mess up?</i>
<i>What if I blurt it all out and the concept doesn’t make sense? </i>
<i>What if the others don’t like my idea?</i>
<br />
<span>
  With all of the anxiety built up, you think “If I just wait for the right time, everything will be
  said how I want it to be said.” You finally build up the courage to speak only to be intercepted
  by the leader who says, ”Thank you everyone for your ideas, I’ll let you know what we decide.”
</span>
<br />
<span>
  You’re left with regret. If only you had spoken sooner, taken that leap of faith, not have worried
  as much about what the others were going to think, then your idea might have been heard. It is
  with this feeling of regret that pushed me into enrolling in the Dale Carnegie Course.{' '}

#### And so it begins

<span>
  The 8-week{' '}
  <a href="https://www.dalecarnegie.com/en/courses/effective-communications">
    Dale Carnegie Course
  </a>{' '}
  was held on Tuesdays from 3:00-6:30pm at the PayPal office in Scottsdale. I had heard a few good
  things about this course from my coworkers and other recent college graduates who had just
  completed the course. I didn’t know what to expect. All I had was anticipation and curiosity on
  what was to come.{' '}
</span>

<br />
<span>
  The first session was a memorable moment for me. I only knew one other person in the room which
  meant that I got to learn 14 different names and faces. Audra, our encouraging leadership coach,
  presented us with a helpful tool to memorize everyone’s names. How we used this tool involved us
  getting out of our seats which made for a fun and high-energy time. By the end of the class, I was
  able to have everyone’s names memorized along with the correct pronunciation!
</span>

<br />
<span>
  At the end of the first session, we were left with a tip on how to get the most out of this
  course: take the time to read <i>How To Stop Worrying And Start Living</i>,{' '}
  <i>How to Win Friends and Influence People</i>, and{' '}
  <i>The Quick & East Way to Effective Speaking</i>.{' '}
</span>
<br />
<span>We also set a vision to work towards throughout the eight weeks:</span>

<br />
<i>I am speaking my thoughts in a clear, concise, and calm manner.</i>
<i>I am establishing more meaningful relationships in a deeper level.</i>

<br />
<span>
  Each week, I found myself becoming more comfortable with the stories that I told. At first, I
  wanted to cater my stories to the class because I wanted to appeal to my audience and I wasn’t
  sure what they would think. In between one of the sessions, I read in{' '}
  <i>The Quick & Easiest Way to Effective Speaking</i> book that{' '}
  <b>no one can tell your story better than you</b>. This along with the support that the class
  exuded gave me that extra boost of confidence that I needed in order to share different aspects of
  my life ranging from a defining moment to a person who’s inspired me and has shaped me into who I
  am today. As a cohort, we all became closer as we connected with one and other each session. With
  all of the fascinating and unique tales that were told, I realized that when given the space,
  everyone has an inspiring story to share.{' '}
</span>
<br />
<span>
  At the end of the course, the 8th session, our managers were invited to hear about our takeaways
  from this course. We started off by introducing our manager and take a moment to thank them for
  the confidence and encouragement that they have given us. In turn, we received a compliment from
  them which leads to the phrase that <i>a little appreciation goes a long way</i>.
</span>

<span>
  With this presentation, I was definitely more nervous than I had been in the past. With the
  helpful stress management techniques from the course, I was able to calm my nerves and turn the
  stress into positive stress and channel the adrenaline. With coaching from Audra, I planted my
  feet against the ground and introduced myself. “Hi everyone, my name is Courtney Ngai. Imagine
  yourself in a room of 10 people and a leader...”{' '}
</span>

<span>
  By speaking about the benefits that I had received from taking this course, I was left with a
  great feeling of accomplishment after I had finished presenting.
</span>

<span>
  To celebrate our completion, we each received a Dale Carnegie Course certificate. As a bonus,
  those who also had 100% attendance received a fancy gold sticker added to their certificate. I
  actually missed a week due to the PayPal RCG (Recent College Graduate) event in San Jose. However,
  Audra took the time outside of the course to meet for a makeup class.
</span>

<span>
  In addition to all of the wonderful benefits and the Certificate of Achievement, I received the{' '}
  <i>Breakthrough Award</i> which contains a blue Dale Carnegie pen. This award meant that I was
  recognized by my peers for stepping out of my comfort zone. While winning an award was always a
  goal that I had in mind, I felt that whomever received this award or any of the awards (Breakout
  or Human Relations), truly deserves this award and that this could be the boost of confidence that
  they need to continue making a positive impact. This week, I intentionally focused more on the
  message of my speech which made receiving the award a terrific surprise! The class has been so
  supportive that this became the perfect opportunity to thank them for the encouragement they’ve
  given on this wonderful journey together.{' '}
</span>
<br />
<span>
  By taking the course, I am able to speak and communicate my thoughts in a clear, concise, and calm
  manner. I am also able to use the conversation tools to establish deeper and more meaningful
  relationships in both my professional and personal lives. When I’m in the office, I pass by so
  many people that I can now say more then just “Hi.” I can ask them more context-specific questions
  such as “How was your weekend?” or “Did you enjoy going to the basketball game?” because of the
  relationship that I’ve built with them. Having taken this leadership course so early in my career,
  I’ve felt that these techniques pushed me to find them in my personal life due to my professional
  career just taking off. However, these techniques are so invaluable that by implementing them now
  in my professional life will prepare me for the presentations that I may have to give in the
  future as well as the connections made during my career.

<span>
  I am grateful that my manager and especially, PayPal encourage us to less as examples within our
  own careers and provides tuition assistance for continuing education. This experience has been
  quite impactful and I have gathered the confidence I need to continue to succeed in my career. As
  a wrap up, I appreciate your taking the time to read this and I hope that you take this course!
