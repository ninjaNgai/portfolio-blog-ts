  I was invited by Karissa aka SushiSis, who I've been friends with since we were practically in our
  mothers' wombs, to vacation in Cabo with her and her parents. It was an absolute dream to
  experience the beautiful landmarks, eat lots of Mexican food, and walk along the beaches. Let me
  tell you about the highlights of this trip!
</span>
<br />

### La Casa by Palmilla Beach

  <span>
    We stayed at a Diamond Resorts timeshare house by Palmilla Beach during our stay. The house was
    fit to hold 8 people so with only 4 of us, we felt like we were in a mansion! There were four
    bedrooms, each with a beautiful view. The kitchen was fully equipped with coffee and espresso
    machines which was a big plus in the morning. By the infinity edge pool, there were pool towels
    and pool noodles. On top of all of this, housekeeping came each day so we didn't have to do
    dishes or laundry! I got to relax and wake up everyday and enjoy the view of the infinity edge
    pool and the sunrise. We also had two golf carts for nearby exploring so we drove around the
    neighborhood and then to Palmilla Beach.

### Flora Farms

  <span>
    When checking out things to do in San José del Cabo,{' '}
    <a href="https://www.flora-farms.com/">Flora Farms</a> came up on <i>TripAdvisor</i>. We decided
    to eat at <i>Flora's Field Kitchen</i> for lunch so I made a{' '}
    <a href="https://reservationswebapp.azurewebsites.net/">reservation</a> the night before since
    we weren't sure how busy the restaurant was going to be.
  </span>
  <br />
  <span>
    Upon arrival, it was so beautiful to see this 25 acre organic working farm located in the
    foothills of the Sierra de la Laguna Mountains. We got seated right away via reservation and we
    got to enjoy live music while we ate. Afterwards, we explored the Shoppes at Flora Farms after
    eating lunch. We also received a mini tour of the farm courtesy of one of the workers there.
    Before we left, we got ice cream from the ice cream stand - I had the Citrus Basil ice cream
    which was perfect for a hot day.

### El Arco de Cabo San Lucas

<br />
<span>
  Even though we were in San José del Cabo, it was only an hour drive to Cabo San Lucas from our
  house so it was a no-brainer to go experience the famous landmark, <i>El Arco</i> or{' '}
  <i>The Arch</i>. Once we got to the beach at El Medano, we took a glass boat tour that was about
  $15 per person. We got to see <i>Land's End</i> and <i>The Arch of Cabo San Lucas</i>. We agreed
  with our boat tour guide to be picked up in 3 hours before getting dropped off at{' '}
  <i>Lover's Beach</i>. It was beautiful to gaze at the huge granite rock formations that went up
  about 500 feet. On the south side, was <i>Divorce Beach</i>, where it was unsafe to swim due to
  the strong winds. We snorkeled at Lover’s Beach and I got to dance on the granite rocks. Before we
  got picked up, a seal came about 10 feet away from us.

### Rancho Ecologico Sol De Mayo - Cascada Waterfall

<div>

  <span>
    In addition to swimming/snorkeling, we wanted to go on a hike. We found the{' '}
    <i>Cascada Sol de Mayo Waterfall</i> hike at Rancho Ecologico Sol De Mayo. I recommend having a
    4-wheel drive car as the main road was all sand with only one lane. We managed to get there in
    our Nissan Altima but it was definitely a question whether to keep driving or turn back.
  </span>
  <br />
  <span>
    When we got there, there was a small farm with goats, fish, and roosters. They asked for a $15
    donation per person and then we were on our way to the waterfall. The signs to the waterfall
    were clear to follow and along the way, there were ropes and stairs. The hike was only .5 miles
    which made the trek into the canyon short and moderately strenuous. Once we got in, the water
    was so clear, we could see little fish swimming around. It was quite a sensory experience
    feeling courser sand and sitting in the cool-temperature waters.

### Balandra Beach

<img width="100%" height="100%" src="/images/Cabo2019/BalandraBeach.png" />

<br />
<span>
  Karissa's dad heard that the Balandra Beach in La Paz had clear waters and was a good spot for
  fly-fishing so we drove two hours from Santiago to La Paz. This beach was perfect for just
  relaxing and enjoying the day. You could wade for about a mile and experience the cool-temperature
  waters. We did have to watch out for stingrays so we were shuffling as we were wading but other
  than that, we got to see huge schools of fish swim around us. We even met a few local girls who
  were in middle school. They only spoke Spanish so we got to practice our Spanish while learn more
  about each other. We happened to take a crash course in Duolingo so that came in handy. There were
  also a few people selling mangoes with tajin which were perfect to enjoy with our chips and
  guacamole salsa.

### The Beautiful Sunrise

<img width="100%" height="100%" src="/images/Cabo2019/Sunrise.jpg" />

<br />
<span>
  On the last day, Karissa and I woke up around 5am and we drove one of the golf carts to a high
  peak in the mountain to watch the sunrise. Sunrises are my favorite thing about nature and my
  relationship with God. I have realized that if something means so much to you, you will make it a
  priority and you will wake up for it - literally or figuratively. In this case, it has been
  literal. However, like God, the sunrise is always there every day for us to appreciate and start
  our day with. The sunrise has been beautiful in every place that I have been in and has made me
  want to appreciate the sunrise wherever I travel next.

## Summary

<span>
  I have never laughed so much in the span of these few days with the memories and stories that
  we've created in the past and present as well as just enjoying each other's company. To be able to
  have a lifetime friend where you can worship God during car rides and explore new destinations, I
  am forever grateful to have been invited to go on this trip with Karissa and her family. We even
  did karaoke the last night which both put us out of our comfort zones!{' '}
