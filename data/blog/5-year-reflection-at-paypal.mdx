_Intention_: In honor of my 5 year anniversary at PayPal, I wanted to take a moment and reflect on what I‚Äôve learned in this past career year. This also doubles as a mid-year reflection which is awesome!

<br />

### Drop the ego for the sake of knowledge

    During my live support rotation as a software engineer, I had 4 tasks that I needed to
    prioritize and 2 where I had no clue how to tackle it. Thanks to my teammates, I got to learn
    more and realize that I don‚Äôt need to appear competent. I've also learned to change the script
    that I was sharing in my head of needing to feel like I appeared competent and knew what I was
    talking about. As a switch, I now tell myself that the things I don't know don't undermine what
    I do know.

### Your health matters

  I firmly believe Health is wealth. A stomach bug took me out for a week. My hyper-functioning self
  had trouble grasping with the lack of productivity. Then I realized that canceling meetings or moving
  them out one week wasn‚Äôt going to make a difference in the long run. It was important that I stayed
  authentic in the speed of which I recovered which was definitely slower than I would have liked. For
  the past 6 months, I realized that I was also involved in 8 projects which was more than what my peers
  were doing. I do embrace being a hyperachiever, however, it's important for me to practice mindful
  rest and relaxation. In these moments of rest, I'm able to recharge, think of more creative ideas and
  think deeper.

### Focus on where you can make an impact

  Three things that I find fulfilling are 1) Understanding the why behind business, product, and technical
  requirements. 2) Receiving mentorship and mentoring the next generation of software engineers via 1:1s.
  3) Maximizing my time each day via timeboxing. I've started to shape my work days around these because
  it's quite motivating to learn and share what I've learned. Another portion is if you understand the
  why, it'll be easier to have a purpose in what you're building along with the sponsorship needed to
  build a product.

### You don't know unless you ask

  I thought I was inconveniencing the other person or taking time out of the meeting to ask my questions
  and instead would try to search for the answers within the existing conversations. Now I've gotten
  more comfortable asking because what I'm curious about is both relevant and there's a high chance someone
  else will have the same question. I also feel that this has pushed me to have a voice and assert my
  opinion. By having an opinion, it's challenged me to think more deeply because I have to weigh pros
  and cons of a tech decision as an example. By also asking more questions with curiosity, I've learned
  that I can assume a mostly positive outcome and response.

### Self-reflect often

  I used to think that I was learning a lot by asking questions about my mentor. Now I'm learning that
  the more I reveal about my struggles, the more I am able to get help and guidance from my mentors.
  I'm learning that it's comfortable to give myself the space and vulnerability to share what I'm experiencing
  in order to figure out how I can take the next step in my career. This year, I've also been trying
  a couple of new things such as 1) 5-min Daily Gratitude Journal. 2) Daily planner. and 3) Emotions
  journal. I feel I've been the most consistent with the Daily planner and Emotions journal because they
  provide the space for me to jot down my tasks for the day as well as how I feel throughout the day.

## Summary

  When reflecting on my 5th year at PayPal, I'm so grateful to be an environment that pushes me to be
  a better engineer, have a large network of mentors, mentees, and colleagues, and have exciting problems
  to create solutions for. The icing on the cake is that I have 4 weeks of sabbatical as a 5 year anniversary
  milestone. I'm planning to go to Seoul, South Korea for dance classes, up my skincare routine, and
  practice my Korean and Osaka, Japan for food, art, and sightseeing!
