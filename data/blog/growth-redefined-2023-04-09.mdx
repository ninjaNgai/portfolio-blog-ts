## Tiny Dances at Phoenix Art Museum

<div>
  <img width="75%" height="75%" src="/images/GrowthRedefined/flyer.jpg" />
  <span>
    <i>Intention</i>: I wanted to take a moment to reflect on my creative process and articulate the
    improvisational movement around my work, Growth Redefined, presented at Tiny Dances at Phoenix
    Art Museum.
  </span>
</div>
<br />

### The Concept

  <blockquote>
    To unlock a new area of self expression, an internal change has to happen. This piece examines
    the question, how do you create a nurturing space for yourself to play and grow?
  </blockquote>
  One of my friends had messaged me on Instagram asking if I was going to create a submission for
  the Tiny Dances. I initially hadn't thought about it because I was rehearsing for an upcoming
  dance festival at the time. On my way to one of the rehearsals, this song came up on my Spotify
  and it struck a chord in me. In order for a change to happen, it has to start from within.

  I chose "Interference" by Tems because I felt this particular song depicted the emotions and phrases
  of what I want to say from a conversational standpoint through movement. I had danced to a few songs
  by Tem from other class choreography and felt like I could bring in different grooves into my improvisation
  that I hadn't used in past improvisational work.

### Show Day!

    <b>Tech rehearsal at Stage 3 - Sculpture Garden </b>
    <br />
    We had a short run through of each dance to understand how each of the artists would enter and
    exit the 4' x 4' stage. Since I was doing improvisation, for me, it was important to get a feel
    for the marley and how much traction I'd get from my socks. This would influence whether I would
    incorporate any spins or mainly stick with jumps, balances, and more arm movement.
  </span>
  <br />
  <br />
  <span>
    <b>STAGE 1 - Outdoor Entrance </b>
    <br />
    There was a different stage at each performance location. This tiny stage, in particular, had
    wood for the flooring instead of the marley covering. I decided to go with the intentional story
    of having a conversation with someone and encouraging them to take risks. To me, when someone's
    encouraging you, they're giving you energy and support which influenced me reaching out or
    creating a shape with my body.
  </span>
  <br />
  <br />
  <span>
    <b>STAGE 3 - Outdoor Entrance Sculpture Garden</b>
    <br />
    For this stage, I focused on balancing and doing movement that would knock me off balance. There
    were a few times which I came close to falling off of the stage but that showed the risks being
    taken. I wasn't quite on my leg for balancing so there were a lot of opportunities to move
    through once I fell of balance.
  </span>
  <br />
  <br />
  <span>
    <b>STAGE 2 - Katz Gallery</b>
    <br />
    For this stage, I wanted one more go with balancing since I felt like I got a sense of where my
    body was in space. I also combined the conversational aspect with my gestures. I also added in
    house footwork as it felt casual and fit with the music. In a showcase of movement experience, I
    managed to balance for a good 20-30 secs and add gestures while balancing. I was also influenced
    by the space because people could watch from three different angles and the balcony of the art
    museum.

### That's a wrap!

<div>
  <span>
    Upon reflection of this piece, I am extremely blessed and grateful to have had the opportunity
    to present Growth Redefined at Tiny Dances @ Phx Art. This opportunity allowed me to further
    explore structured improvisation in a small space and combine both conversational movement and
    footwork. Huge thank you to Carley Conder of CONDER/dance and Nicole Olson for the opportunity!
