<span>
  <span style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>Author's notes</span>: I wanted to be able to
  challenge myself and think of another connection between Computer Science and Dance that hasn't
  been created before. A couple months ago, I was learning about the PageRank Algorithm and
  reflecting on current videos of my movement during my dance improvisation sessions. I noticed that
  I would do moves that I had either done in class right before I did a session or bring out moves
  that I have done in the past month. Noticing this retrieval of frequency, recency, and relevancy,
  I started drawing connections between movement improvisation and the PageRank Algorithm.

### What is the PageRank Algorithm?

<span>
  The concept of the PageRank algorithm is that the rank of a web page is higher if several pages
  link to that web page. Links from highly ranked pages are given more weight than links from
  less-highly ranked pages.{' '}

<b>An intuitive model</b>
<span>
  The concept of the PageRank algorithm is that the rank of a web page is higher if several pages
  link to that web page. Links from highly ranked pages are given more weight than links from
  less-highly ranked pages.
  <ol>
    <li>Starts at a random page on the web. </li>
    <li>
      Clicks on a random hyperlink from the page that they are on and goes to the corresponding
      page.
    </li>
    <li>Repeat step 2 multiple times.</li>
  </ol>

<b>Some useful concepts:</b>
<div>
  <span>
    <span style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>Relevance</span> is conventionally defined as
    binary (relevant or not relevant). It is typically estimated by the similarity between the terms
    in the query and each document.
  </span>
  <br />
  <span>
    <span style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>Importance</span> measures documents by how useful
    they might be to a variety of users. It is usually estimated by some measure of popularity.
  </span>
  <br />
  <span>
    Web search engines rank documents by a weighted combination of estimates of relevance and
    importance.

## How does the PageRank Algorithm connect with Movement Improvisation?

<div>
  <span>
    In a movement improvisation session, I improvise to a few different songs for roughly 60 secs to
    420 seconds. Even though the song is in one genre, I don't improvise in only one dance style. I
    like to pull from the different styles of dance that I have learned. For learning about my
    movement process, I try to record each time I improvise. After watching these recordings, I
    noticed a frequency of certain moves that I would use each time I improvised.
  </span>
  <br />
  <span>
    In connection to the PageRank Algorithm, we can view each time I improvise as a document
    containing a vocabulary which is essentially unique moves (terms). Each document may contain
    some of the same terms as other documents thus creating a similarity.
  </span>
</div>
<br />

### How did I make this connection?

<div>
  <span>
    At the time of this discovery, I was taking a contemporary ballet class three-days a week. A
    typical contemporary ballet class consisted of barre, center-floor adagio, small jumps, and then
    pirouettes and occasionally, grand allegro across the diagonal. Due to the fact that I was
    accessing the ballet vocabulary consistently, I would find that my movement in the successive
    improvisation sessions included more movement from the ballet vocabulary more than the other
    movement vocabularies I have acquired such as tap, jazz, latin (cha cha, salsa), and urban
    styles (popping, locking, breaking).
  </span>
  <br />
  <br />
  <span>
    The natural tendency to use one movement over another can be connected to the process of how a
    web search engine ranks documents:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Relevance - the movement improvisation sessions would typically occur right after a
        contemporary ballet class was taken. The movement vocabulary available was already primed
        with ballet vocabulary, therefore, relevant.{' '}
      </li>
      <li>
        Importance - I was required to utilize the ballet vocabulary in the class before an
        improvisation session thus the ballet vocabulary was deemed more important than the other
        dance vocabularies that I have stored.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </span>
</div>
<br />

### And the connection is...

<div>
  <span>
    Our brain is more likely to draw movement from our movement vocabulary that has been accessed
    more frequently and recently. Each time we access a movement, the percentage corresponding to
    that movement increases in relation to all of the other movements. As we continue accessing a
    particular set of movements more frequently than others, we habitually create a comfort zone and
    a natural pattern for moving in real time. A possible explanation may be that in an attempt to
    conserve energy after moving, we take the path of least resistance.
  </span>
  <br />
  <span>
    In recognizing these habits, we can expand our creativity by exploring different ways to create
    new movement pathways to equalize the distribution of percentages across a movement vocabulary.
    Thus, even though the movement choice is random, each choice has an equal shot.
