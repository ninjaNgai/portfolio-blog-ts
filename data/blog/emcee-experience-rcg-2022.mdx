summary: 'A reflection on hosting the very first PayPal 2022 Global RCG Conference.'
---

_Intention_: I wanted to take a moment to reflect on just how amazing it was to emcee the very first PayPal 2022 Global RCG Conference that took place Feb 15-17, 2022. I had the pleasure of leading the conversations with the 2021 RCG cohort and keynote speakers such as John Rainey, Sri Shivananda, and Kausik Rajgopal along with VPs, Directors, and leaders around the globe.

  To get everyone on the same page, RCG translates to Recent College Graduate. For the last few months,
  the University Experience team worked hard to bring together over 300 recent college grads who joined
  us in 2021 from North America, India, Shanghai, and Singapore for three days of learning, networking,
  and having fun!
  <br />
  Now because this conference was GLOBAL, I could not have done this without the APAC emcees, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sakshisharma15/">
    Sakshi Sharma
  </a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/suraj-arulmozhi-885822156/">Suraj Arulmozhi</a>. When
  I first met up with Sakshi, Suraj, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gloriahcho/">
    Gloria Cho
  </a> (the Global University Experience Program Manager of this conference), and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aiswarya-das/">
    Aiswarya Das
  </a> (the APAC Program Manager) to discuss conference preparation, we actually forgot to introduce
  ourselves to each other because the chemistry between all of us was phenomenal! It felt like we had
  already known each other for years!

  />
  Prior to the conference, the emcees also received the same swag that the RCGs received. I was excited
  when the box arrived as I have really enjoyed wearing the shirts and jackets that I've accumulated
  over from the 2018 internship, 2019 RCG conference, as well as other projects that I've been involved
  in throughout the past couple of years. Not only are the shirts and jackets very comfortable and of
  high-quality, it's also been really cool wearing the logos and designs. This Spring 2022 RCG collection
  was exceptional! I couldn't wait to wear these during the conference!
  <br />
  Now, fast-forward to Monday evening before the conference started on Tuesday evening. I met with the
  emcees and the University Experience team (Gloria, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mtaquino/">
    Melissa Aquino
  </a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mindy-holt-41304831/">Mindy Holt</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ava-toren-532ba61a1/">
    Ava Toren
  </a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariaman%C3%A9-akopyan-47ab921aa/">
    Maria Akopyan
  </a> from the North Americas region; Aiswarya and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/priyanka-nayak-06618353/">
    Priyanka Nayak
  </a> from India region; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joannafjw/">Joanna Foo</a> from Singapore
  region). We did a mock run-through of the show where the emcees went over our scripts to introduce
  the keynote speakers and leaders. In addition to the scripts, we had the corresponding PowerPoint slides
  and a fun playlist to accompany the speakers' entrances. Recalling the nostalgia from my performance
  days, it felt like a dress rehearsal!
  <br />
  Even though we had a mock run-through on Monday evening, we also had a second run-through on Tuesday
  morning. Despite having previous performance experience, I was both nervous and excited leading up
  to Tuesday night.

# Day 1: Opening night!

### Keynote Speaker: John Rainey

<br />
"Our first keynote speaker serves as PayPal’s Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of
Global Customer Operations. As CFO, he is responsible for leading PayPal’s financial operations, corporate
accounting, corporate finance, treasury, sourcing functions, and more. Bringing more than 20 years of
financial management experience to his role, please put your hands together and let’s welcome John Rainey!
👏🏻👏🏼👏🏽👏🏾👏🏿" - Courtney Ngai

<div>
  At 6:30 PM PST, we kicked off with some fantastic career advice from John Rainey, CFO & EVP hosted
  by yours truly. This session was a fireside chat which meant that if the RCGs had any questions
  they could come onto the screen and directly ask, or I would read them from the Microsoft Teams
  chat. One key takeaway from speaking with John was that he emphasized the importance of
  communication. This meant having clarity about what you are asking for. Whether it's working with
  another colleague, outlining a career goal, or even giving a presentation, be clear about your
  intention. He also mentioned that communication is a learned skill, and shared that it took him
  time to build up this skill - which I never would have known because it seemed so natural for him!
  As the host for this session, there were a number of great questions asked in the half hour that
  we had with John. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. I was so inspired by what John had
  to say that I wrapped it up in a bottle and took it into the next day's sessions!

### Magic Show

"As it’s getting later for the North Americas, I’m going to bring on the APAC emcees, Sakshi and Suraj, and pass the introduction baton to them. Sakshi and Suraj, take it away!
Suraj: Up next, we have an awesome magic show for you all to enjoy... "

<br />
<div>
  For the North Americas region, we wrapped up our evening with an entertaining show from{' '}
  <a href="https://kevinblakemagic.com/">Kevin Blake</a>. From card tricks to illusions, I went
  between laughing and being in awe throughout the entire show! A number of RCGs were randomly
  selected to participate and even our very own emcee, Sakshi, turned out to be psychic! 😉

## Day 2: The world is your oyster!

### RCG through the Generations

_A Fireside Chat of RCG Success Stories_

  "Good Morning and Good Evening RCGs! For this fireside chat, we’ve got a wonderful panel of RCGs
  through the generations and I’m excited to learn more about their experiences at PayPal..."

<br />

<div>
  At 7:00 AM PST, we invited five RCG alumni to share their stories and experiences at PayPal hosted
  by our emcees, Sakshi and Suraj. A key takeaway from these discussions was that a good way to stay
  engaged is by finding problems to solve both in and outside of work. Within your own team, you can
  find opportunities to challenge yourself. In addition, there are numerous areas and teams within
  PayPal that you can collaborate with based off of your interests and what you find as fun
  challenges. I truly appreciated hearing about how each of the panelists' journey as each was so
  unique!

### Leader: Lauren White

_Creating authentic and impactful careers_

<p>
  Up next, our speaker has been with PayPal for over 10 years and during that time has had a number
  of roles... In the last two years, she has been serving on the Global Talent Development team as
  Director of Employee Engagement. Please put your hands together and let’s welcome to the stage,
  Lauren White! 👏🏻👏🏼👏🏽👏🏾👏🏿

  />
  At 8:00 AM PST, we had the pleasure of learning and discussing about how we can bring our authentic
  selves to work. I thoroughly enjoyed the conversations with the RCGs and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauren-white-b1780bb1/">
    Lauren White
  </a>. One key takeaway was building a timeline of our life starting from birth to present to outline
  what were the highlights and low points of our life that form who we are today. Another takeaway was
  to ask for honest feedback. At first, it seems daunting to ask our coworkers and manager how we can
  improve. Lauren advised that this has to be exercised like a muscle to get more comfortable with incorporating
  the feedback and growing.

### Leader: Christine Jensen

  "Up next, we have the Vice President of PayPal’s Global Customer operations. She’s been
  responsible for establishing sites in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia, Chennai India, and Chandler AZ. Her
  large internal network is a testament to her exceptional collaborational skills, how awesome is
  that? She has led both Operations and Support Teams during her 15 years at PayPal, everyone please
  welcome to the stage, Christine Jensen! 👏🏻👏🏼👏🏽👏🏾👏🏿"

  At 9:30 AM PST, we got the opportunity to have a fireside chat with <a href="/images/Emcee2022/Christine Jensen.jpg">
    Christine Jensen
  </a> and learn more about the Global Customer operations sector. She shared several interesting statistics
  such as the cost of each call at a call center, the satisfaction ratio, and Key Performance Indicators.
  I found myself coming up with a number of questions as my curiosity grew. One question I asked was,
  <br />
  <div>
    With a number of products that the call center supports ranging from Venmo, Braintree, to
    PayPal's Buy Now Pay Later product, how do you get up to speed with each product that gets
    launched?
