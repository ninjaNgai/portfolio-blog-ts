    <i>Intention</i>: I want to take a moment to reflect on the <i>Start With Why</i> by Simon Sinek
    book that I recently read as way to summarize the points that resonated with me. This blog post
    also serves as a reference to come back to whenever I mention this book to friends and
    colleagues.

  <br />
  <b>How did I come across this book?</b>
  <br />
  <span>
    I found this book from a "10 Books for ENTJs" list and was intrigued by the title. During 2020,
    I would take dance classes at 2AM from choreographers in Korea, Australia, and New York because
    I had a burning curiosity of learning about their thought process behind creating the
    choreography. I then realized, I was interested in their "Why" behind the movement because
    learning the choreography was like physically experiencing an art piece. In addition, a rule I
    also am actively applying when reading is that I will read at least 10 pages but no more than a
    chapter in a day. This allows me to block my time rather than let time get away from me. I
    learned this from Effortless: Make It Easier to Do What Matters by Greg Mckeown. Blog post of
    the recap <a href="">here</a>.

<blockquote>
  There are only two ways to influence human behavior: you can manipulate it or you can inspire it
</blockquote>
<div>
  This line resonated with me as manipulations are widely used in marketing and sales. There are the
  typical manipulations such as lowering the price, fear tactics, running a promotion, peer
  pressure, or making promises to influence behavior. While these manipulations are effective, the
  effect is temporary. You play the short game instead of the long game.
</div>

<br />
<blockquote>
  In the business-to-business world, promotions are called "value added". But the principles are the
  same - give something away for free to reduce the risk so that someone will do business with you.
</blockquote>
<div>
  The term "value added" turned a light bulb on in my brain. In working with installment products
  that include promotions, there are also associated "value added" fees. I never knew why we used
  this term until I read the above line. In addition, a business requirement such as "the merchant
  needs to have these "value added" fees configured" informs what we code and design. Therefore,
  this further stresses the importance of understanding why we're using this terminology and how
  they're associated with the products we're building.
</div>

<br />
<blockquote>
  The goal of business should not be to do business with anyone who simply wants what you have. It
  should be to focus on the people who believe what you believe. When we are slective about doing
  business only with those who believe in our WHY, trust emerges.

<div>
  A good mentor of mine came up with the term "harvest hunting" as opposed to using the commonly
  used term, "cold calling". I appreciate this perspective because the point of harvest hunting is
  to find your wells of companies that align with your mission (your why). Instead of making 100
  cold calls, seek 10 companies that share the same goals/values that your product seeks to
  accomplish. That way you intentionally invest your time into potential partners.
</div>

<br />
<blockquote>
  The goal is to hire those who are passionate for your WHY, your purpose, cause or belief, and who
  have the attitude that fits your culture.

  In 2022, I conducted interviews for expanding my team and finding potential candidates for 2023
  internships. I evaluated each interview using the following criteria: 1) Can they explain their
  thought process? Which was more important than arriving to a working solution. 2) Do they have a
  curiosity for learning? 3) Are they someone that I want to work with every day? From my internship
  to full-time, I've consistently been a culture champion as I truly believe that it's the people
  who make the work both fascinating and enjoyable. When you get to work with folks who create an
  environment that I would describe as a group project where each person is that one member who does
  all of the work, the learnings and experience is invaluable.

<br />
<blockquote>
  The role of a leader is to create an environment in which great ideas can happen.
</blockquote>
<div>
  In a group setting, I naturally find myself sitting back and listening to the exchange of ideas. I
  then create visuals in my head to understand how all of the ideas relate and what we can start
  building off of the ideas. In any meetings that I conduct as a tech lead, I strive to ensure that
  every voice and idea is heard.
</div>

<br />
<blockquote>
  Calculated risks accepts that there can be great losses, but steps are taken to either guard
  against or respond to an unlikely but possible outcome.
</blockquote>
<div>
  A mentor told me that she jumps into things head on yet she acts with intention. This resonated
  with me because you have to try yet still be conscious of the choices that are being made. I feel
  this is important because you can only go so far theoretically. There's going to be a part where
  you have to take action and gather all of the learnings you can as the actions continue.
</div>

<br />
<blockquote>
  only when individuals can trust the culture or oganization will they take personal risks in order
  to advance that culture or organization as a whole.
</blockquote>
<div>
  I had read about psychological safety in the past yet hadn't fully experienced it until I started
  having monthly 1:1s with skip-level leadership. By knowing that leadership has my back and is
  invested in my career, I feel more empowered to take risks that have both the organization and
  culture in mind. For example, we were looking to create a FAQ Slack bot for one of our live
  support help channels. I was curious about how Slackbots were built and eventually took it upon
  myself over a weekend to build a slackbot that would reply in thread with an answer with a list of
  10 FAQs when a person posted in the respective slack channel. While we didn't launch this
  slackbot, we found a team that already had a slackbot that supported our requirements. The awesome
  thing about this is that this solution would fit for all teams as they would only need to have a
  document with their FAQs and the id of their live support slack channel.

<blockquote>
  WHY-types are the visionaries, the ones with the overactive imaginations. They tend to be
  optimists who believe that all the things they imagine can actually be accomplished.
</blockquote>
<div>
  An example of how I identify with this is in my practice of improvisational dance. I enjoy
  exploring the different options of how one movement can lead to the next. I also set an intention
  such as "What if you kept the movement flowing instead of creating hard stops?" and "What if you
  encompassed the feelings of the song only? Or the beats only?" that starts of the movement
  exploration. These "what-if?" questions inspire my curiosity to try different options and also not
  stop until there's an outcome that I'm satisfied with.

### Summary

<div>
  In reflection, it was great to compile all of the points that resonated with me whether it was
  through advice that a mentor has shared with me or personal experiences. I was finally able to
  understand why I had the energy to dance at 2AM in the night and also be able to apply these
  learnings in my career. In addition, I also learned some vocabulary and added it to the bottom of
  this post for reference. If you've made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read as I
  hoped you got something from this post as well. Happy reading!

### Terms

<b>Breakage</b>
<ol>
  <li>
    In accounting, an amount of money set aside to cover the cost of goods that break during
    transport. Because these goods cannot be sold, the company loses the revenue they would produce.
    A company may prevent this revenue loss from adversely affecting its finances by setting aside a
    breakage allowance. This exists due to fiscal conservatism and not because a company expects an
    unusual number of goods to break.
  </li>
  <li>
    In retail, a gift card that is purchased but not used. The revenue a retailer generates from
    breakage is all profit, except for the minimal costs necessary to produce the cards.
  </li>
</ol>

<b>Slippage</b>
<ol>
  <li>
    The difference between estimated transactions costs and actual transactions costs. The
    difference usually represents revisions to price difference or spread and commission costs.
