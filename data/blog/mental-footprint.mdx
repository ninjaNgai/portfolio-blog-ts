## A Contemporary/Krump fusion structured-improvisation solo

<div>
  <img align="right" src="/images/MentalFootprint/MentalFootprint_Square.png" />
  <span>
    <i>Intention</i>: I wanted to take a moment to reflect on the the evolution of this piece from
    process to product, the improvisational movement research realized, and acknowledge the talented
    artists that I gotten to work with throughout this adventure!
  </span>
  <br />
  <h3>The Initial Concept</h3>
  <span>
    Originally, the concept started out as <i>Do You Feel Empowered?</i> which was created when I
    went on social media, such as Facebook and Instagram, and found myself scrolling, always
    refreshing for new content. It became a mindless habit that I wanted to break out of. I wanted a
    change. And so I challenged myself by adding my own voice to the music for this piece because I
    thought,
  </span>
  <blockquote>"If I'm not using my own voice, then who's voice am I using?"</blockquote>
</div>

### Music Creation

<div>
  <span>
    This sound score initially started as a 2 min track consisting of a minute of suspenseful beats
    followed by a minute of spoken word (
    <a href="https://soundcloud.com/courtney-ngai-749460472/do-you-feel-empowered-11">
      Do You Feel Empowered? - Strong Draft
    </a>
    ). In November 2018, I presented a work-in-progress solo using this 2 min track in the ASU Fall 2018
    Informals Concert. A month later, I was told that I had been nominated by the ASU Dance Faculty to
    present this solo in one of the ACDA 2019 Informals Concerts in San Jose. Because this solo was still
    a work-in-progress, I wanted to present a more refined version of this solo that was at least 3 mins
    in length.
  </span>
  <span>
    Knowing that I was going to present at ACDA Informals, I extended the track to be 3 mins in
    length. I actually added to the beginning of this track rather than after because of how the
    spoken word was structured - the last line was "Drop" which I associated with the movement of a
    mic drop. I added on the line{' '}
  </span>
  <blockquote>"Each name represents a lifetime" </blockquote>
  <span>
    which was derived from the{' '}
    <a href="https://media.centralaz.com/2018/12/02/whats-in-a-name/">What's In a Name?</a>{' '}
    (11:38-11:42) sermon that I had listened to on December 2018. I also discovered the Slicing
    technique in Maschine 2.0 so I took the "Each" clip and made a melody. Prior to ACDA, I was
    fortunate to have been given the opportunity by Carley Conder, Artistic Director of CONDER|dance
    to present the 3 min version solo a few times at the following promotional events: First Friday
    At Phoenix Arts Museum, Family Sunday at Phoenix, and Performance with a View at Tempe Center
    for the Arts for the Breaking Ground - Contemporary Dance Festival 2019.

  <span>
    Even though track had reached 3 mins, I wanted to add on 30-40 seconds more because of the
    energy that I receive from a supportive audience while performing. In conjunction with
    empowerment, I added in the phrase "You have the power". All of these recordings were done on an
    iPhone 7 which surprisingly produced good quality.

### The Costume

<div>

  <span>
    I wanted a top that where I could just rearrange the fabric and it would stay. I discovered the
    <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/645460271/asymmetrical-avant-garde-top-unisex-vest?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=avant+garde+top&ref=sr_gallery-1-14&pro=1&col=1">
      Celestial Body Shop
    </a> from the Ukraine on Etsy that sold a white asymmetrical Avant-garde deconstructed jacket - it
    was perfect! For the pants, I wanted to deviate from black leggings for lighting purposes. I went
    with olive green leggings as I liked how it paired with the white top. I also added my <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-series-4/">
      iWatch 4
    </a> with a white wristband as it went with the top while also highlighting the grip that the "ability
    to stay connected" has on us.

  <h3>Adjudications</h3>
  <span>
    On adjudications day for the ASU Spring 2019 Dance Undergraduate Project Presentations, this is
    what I presented as my elevator pitch to the Artistic Directors, Mia and Manon, and{' '}
    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ASU-Dance-Undergraduate-Organization-Support-DUOS-277775925582730/">
      ASU DUOS
    </a>{' '}
    (Dance Undergraduate Organization Support):
  </span>
  <blockquote>
    This dance explores the question, <i>What makes a lasting impression?</i> with the intention of
    creating a mental footprint that lasts longer than our digital footprint. In addition, I
    performed the piece in full costume for the sake of professionalism and presentation.
  </blockquote>
  <span>
    {' '}
    As a result, the concept was well-received and the piece made it into the Undergraduate Show! This
    was the feedback given from the adjudication panel:
  </span>
  <ul>
    <li>Use of text worked with your intention very well </li>
    <li>Could tell there was a lot of thought that went into this process </li>
    <li>Filled the stage in many ways: presence, musicality, spacing, focus </li>
    <li>Volume level of text within sound could be a little louder to be a little more powerful</li>
  </ul>
</div>

### Improvisation Process

<span>
  This was actually the first piece that I've done where I've improvised to this sound score for 5
  months, evolution and all. With the opportunities that I have had to present an improvisational
  solo to each evolved version of the track, I found myself doing the same movement to certain parts
  of the music. This led me to create a connection between movement improvisation and the
  <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/page-rank-algorithm-implementation/">PageRank Algorithm</a>.
</span>
<div>
  <img
    align="right"
    width="300"
    height="500"
    src="/images/MentalFootprint/how-pagerank-works.png"
  />
  <span>
    In parallel to the PageRank Algorithm, we can view each movement improvisation as a document
    containing different moves (words). Our brain is more likely to draw movement from our movement
    vocabulary that has been accessed more frequently. Each time we access a movement, the
    percentage corresponding to that movement increases in relation to all of the other movements.
    As we continue accessing a particular set of movements more frequently than others, we
    habitually create a comfort zone and a natural pattern for moving in real time. If the point is
    to create and discover new movement, it is essential be exposed to movement outside our movement
    vocabulary for a distribution of percentages.

### Improvisation Process

<div>
  <img align="right" src="/images/MentalFootprint/LightingBoard.jpg" />
  <span>
    For the Fall 2018 and Spring 2018 Undergraduate Project Presentations, I have had one of my best
    friends, Cheyenne, design the lighting for my first solo,{' '}
    <a href="https://youtu.be/a1joxnqzIq4">You Donâ€™t Know Me But You Will</a> and my second solo,
    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FY1SkEeCbA">Content in Archi-texture</a>. With the work that she did for
    both pieces and her background as a dancer, she's come to understand how I improvise within the space.
    Therefore, I couldn't have thought of anyone else to light this piece. While I had some ideas, I
    still gave her full control of the lighting design. Instead of basing the cues off of the movement,
    she based the cues off of the timing of the music. I truly appreciate her unique perspective and
    experience so it was a no brainer to have her as the lighting designer!

### Show Week!

<div>
  <img align="right" width="250" height="350" src="/images/MentalFootprint/Manon-Mia.jpg" />
  <span>
    With improvisational pieces, I find that it is important to allot at anywhere from a half hour
    to an hour on warm-up prior to performing. Since I was the second piece, I had my hair and
    makeup done before call-time which was an hour and a half before show. As a personal movement
    practice, I start with a ballet center-barre warming up before moving into the styles for this
    piece which included contemporary, popping, and krump. It's incredibly important to experiment
    with being on and off my center as each transition that I make happens in real-time. As
    performance-time gets closer, I play the song on repeat to bring the rhythms back into memory
    recall.
  </span>
  <br />
  <span>
    For Thursday's performance, it was wonderful to feel the support of friends and family there. I
    always think about how I want this piece to be perceived and with the wonderful comments that I
    received from people who I didn't even know, it spoke volumes about how accessible this piece
    can be.
  </span>
  <br />
  <span>
    Friday's performance was bitter-sweet. It's difficult to think that this was possibly the last
    time that I'd be performing in the Margaret Gisolo Dance Theatre, however, I have realized that
    it is truly people that make each performance special. Throughout my dance career, my family,
    especially my parents, have been at all of my performances, competitions, etc. I also have such
    supportive friends that I've made while at ASU.

### That's a wrap!

<div>
  <span>
    In reflection, I am extremely grateful to have been blessed with the chance to present this
    piece at ACDA, Phoenix Art Museum, Tempe Center For the Arts, and now the ASU 2019 Spring Dance
    Undergraduate Project Presentations. This piece has shown me that one person can make a
    difference and I hope that I have inspired many as much as I have been inspired by the numerous
    mentors that have come into my life.
