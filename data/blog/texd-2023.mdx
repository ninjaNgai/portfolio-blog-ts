_Intention_: I wanted to take a moment to reflect on the awesome time that I had in Atlanta as a volunteer at the PayPal Booth at Tech Exposure Day sponsored by the CodeHouse.

### Background

<span>
  As a PayPal volunteer, I got the opportunity to share my unique perspective as a participant in
  both PayPal‚Äôs Internship and Recent Graduate Programs. I‚Äôm grateful to have been able to give back
  to these local students from the Atlanta metropolitan area and be able to make an impact in terms
  of their careers.

### 8:00 AM - Arrive at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium

  <span>
    I got to carpool with another PayPal volunteer as we were both staying at the same hotel. Once
    we entered the underground area, we were ultimately blown away as we walked into the stadium. I
    could not believe that we were literally on the field! It was a surreal feeling and made the
    experience that much sweeter. We set up our booth with our PayPal swag of stickers, notebooks,
    pens, flags, and more and had a couple of tokens for the Scavenger hunt where they would answer
    questions to be entered for a $1,000 scholarship, PS5, and more. I also got to connect with
    fellow PayPalians (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mario-lopez-jr/">Mario</a>,{' '}
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mukesh-gopinadhan/">Mukesh</a>, and{' '}
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katrinadeisler/">Katie</a>) who I had never met before. It
    was inspiring to hear their backgrounds and the excitement that they had as well around making
    an impact in these students‚Äô careers.

  <span>
    The students started coming in and before we knew it, we were talking to groups of students who
    were curious about PayPal, what internships PayPal offers, and more about what I do at PayPal
    and the Pay Later space. It was amazing to hear them share about their career aspirations such
    as a Software Engineer, Pilot, Cybersecurity, Social worker, psychologist, and more. I was also
    able to help those who didn‚Äôt know what they wanted to pursue as a career yet. By mainly asking
    more about what they enjoyed doing for fun, students shared that they enjoyed drawing art with
    pens, drawing graphic designs digitally, and making a game on a calculator. There were so many
    great questions being asked as well such as ‚ÄúHow does PayPal prevent fraud?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat coding
    languages does PayPal use?‚Äù, ‚ÄúDoes PayPal have jobs in marketing? Or social media?‚Äù, and ‚ÄúDo you
    feel represented as a woman in tech?‚Äù. The morning flew by so quickly that I was shocked when it
    was 1:30 pm and it was time to start packing up our booth. We only had a few stickers left too!

  <h3> ‚úÖ Dance on the field @ Mercedes Benz Stadium </h3>
  <span>
    As the event was ending, I managed to get a dance video to also capture my excitement and joy.
    I‚Äôm so thankful for this opportunity, being able to share it with the other PayPalians, and I
    left Atlanta with a full heart.

  <h3>‚úÖ Georgia Aquarium</h3>
  <span>
    My plan had arrived earlier than expected so I managed to get 2 hours in the Georgia Aquarium.
    Once I entered the aquarium, I went straight to the Ocean Voyager. I was amazed by the whale
    sharks, the different fish, the tunnel, and the large movie-screen-like view of the tank.{' '}
  </span>
  <br />
  <span>
    I managed to get some dance videos too in both the tunnel and movie-screen-like wall of the
    Ocean Voyager, and by the belugas as I feel that I‚Äôm able to remember the experience better
    through improvisational movement in real-time. In addition, I saw the belugas, sea otters, deep
    sea fish, and sea lions. I also crawled through the 3ft tunnels to experience how tall the
    puffins are and see them up close.

  <h3>Ramen üçú & Gelato üç®</h3>
  <h3>@Ponce City Market</h3>
  <span>
    I was able to meet my coworker and his wife in-person for the first time and we walked around
    the Ponce City Market before deciding what to eat. Both curious about the ramen scene and having
    a craving for ramen, I got the opportunity to choose where we went for dinner so I chose Ton Ton
    Ramen & Yakitori. I got the Hakata Tonkatsu Classic and the broth was so savory! Afterwards, we
    still had some room for dessert and got Salted Caramel Brownie gelato at Honeysuckle Gelato. It
    hit the spot!

  <span>
    I also got to stay at the Marriott Marquis and was blown away by both the architecture and just
    how many floors there were. The elevators looked futuristic and were so fast! I stayed on the
    30th floor and had a great view of the city. This was only about a 5 min drive from the stadium.

  <h3>Summary üôáüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</h3>

  <span>
    While my time in Atlanta was short, I‚Äôm so grateful to have been able to share my experience and
    connect with local students in Atlanta, appreciate the sea life, and last but most certainly not
    least, get to meet up with my teammate in person. There‚Äôs a lot of inspiration in Atlanta from
    the art to the studies and I‚Äôm so thankful to have been a part of Tech Exposure Day and
    represent PayPal!
