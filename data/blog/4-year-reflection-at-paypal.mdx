_Intention_: In honor of my 4 year anniversary at PayPal, I wanted to take a moment and reflect on what I‚Äôve learned in this past career year. This also doubles as a mid-year reflection which is awesome!

### Find or create opportunities

    Find or create opportunities for you to make an impact outside of your daily work. In this past
    work year, I've been mentoring, being mentored, and have been blessed with opportunities to
    where I had to decide which opportunities would help me make the most impact. An opportunity
    that I leaned into is co-hosting our Credit User Experience Engineering forum series. This
    series is co-hosted by women software engineers and provides a platform for engineers to share
    ideas and present any initiatives that they worked on in the last month. I also joined RISE, the
    Pan-Asian Employee Resource Group at PayPal. I've also been helping one of the IT folks who's
    leveling up in his full-stack engineering skills which has been so rewarding to see the growth!
    And another opportunity is that I've been helping with University outreach where I've gotten to
    travel to Atlanta for <a href="https://www.iamcngai.com/blogs/texd-2023">TEXD Codehouse</a> and
    host a{' '}

### Expand your network of mentors

  Expand your network of mentors both in your role and outside of your domain to better understand different
  areas within the company. The longer I work at PayPal, the more I realize that it's a people company.
  Through a Buy Now Pay Later project that I've been a tech lead on, I've met and have been learning
  from an amazing marketing mentor and later, thanks to a breakout room in the How To Find a Sponsor
  session, I got randomly connected with a Sales Enablement rockstar who worked on another aspect of
  Buy Now Pay Later.
  <br />
  I've also connected with other engineers in the mobile domain to understand their architecture and
  have also gotten a lot of wisdom from engineering managers to build my leadership skills. In these
  connections, I've realized how each domain plays a role which has helped me big a better picture of
  the PayPal ecosystem.

### Communicate your goals

  />
  Communicate your goals with both your mentors and management. A mentor gave me the advice that it‚Äôs
  important to share my goals and how I‚Äôm working towards them as a way to increase the visibility of
  my work. This opens the pathway to receiving more support and how a mentor can best use their skills
  to help me. Another mentor also told me that it's ok to ask people for their help because they want
  to help and don't know how they can help until you tell them. Both advice has helped me become more
  comfortable in sharing and in turn, I've gotten so much more knowledge on how I can work towards these
  goals.

### Write and draw out your ideas

  />
  Write and draw out your ideas to best communicate them with others. I've read that it‚Äôs better to write
  down and or draw out your ideas when communicating them to your team. That way, everyone can get on
  the same page faster and start asking questions because there‚Äôs less reliance on memory to construct
  your vision. During meetings, I often take notes and share my screen for everyone when it‚Äôs useful
  to look over. These notes help determine next steps and as a recap in case anyone missed the meeting.
  <br />
  I've also been leading with a few process improvement initiatives such as improving our organization's
  documentation, how we process feature intake items, and creating a central document of all of the tech
  stories needed for completing a project. Each of these initiatives involved providing the necessary
  information to keep everyone on the same page so that the processes can continue running.

### Your past experiences can always help

<div>
  <img align="right" width="325px" height="400px" src="/images/4Year/Chicago.png" />
  In this past year, I‚Äôve been a co-tech lead on a Buy Now Pay Later solution that involved integrating
  with a pilot partner. After the integration was successful, our director suggested that we write a
  blog post for the internal tech blog around our Product and Tech wins. This was such a great idea and
  because I currently blog for my dance pieces, I found it easier to create the tech blog outline. We
  covered the problem statement, solution, front-end decisions such as using Vite, back-end decisions
  around architecture and solving multiple environments, and lastly the product KPIs and wins.

### Your experiences are yours

<div>
  <img align="left" style={{ paddingRight: '1rem' }} src="/images/4Year/Aquarium.jpg" />
  Your experiences are yours and the outcome doesn‚Äôt directly reflect on your skills. This past April,
  I got promoted to Software Engineer 3 and it took some time to process and celebrate this win. As a
  high-achiever, I have a tendency to look at the next thing and/or others who are also high-achieving
  with experiences that are different from mine. A mentor told me that regardless of what happens, I‚Äôve
  still accomplished these great things such as being a tech lead for an internal product, moving the
  team from scrum to a hybrid of scrum and kanban, and being a tech lead for an external product. Also,
  with a promotion, it‚Äôs a ‚ÄúCongratulations! You‚Äôre already operating at the next level.‚Äù.

<br />

### Celebrate your wins.

<div>
  <img align="left" style={{ paddingRight: '1rem' }} src="/images/4Year/Escape.JPG" />A year ago,
  this is where I wanted to be and with working smart, I was able to get there. A mentor told me
  that it's important to celebrate these wins (big or small) because I tend to always look forward,
  whether it's the next project or next level. In expanding my self awareness, my achiever
  personality has me looking up but not focusing on the outward and down as well. To celebrate the
  promotion, I had a nice steak and lobster and highly recommend doing this!

## Summary

<div>
  <img align="right" src="/images/4Year/San_Jose.jpg" />
  When reflecting on my 4th year at PayPal, I'm so grateful that I get to work with such phenomenal team
  members, have such supportive people managers as mentors (both past and present!), and have an abundance
  of mentors and mentees. I'm incredibly thankful for the different opportunities that allow you to grow
  in numerous areas such as engineering, product, business, marketing, and leadership. It's really up
  to me to push my growth and I'm excited to see how my curiosities evolve into processes, products,
  and more!
