## A Contemporary/House/Latin fusion improvisation solo

  <span>
    <i>Intention</i>: I wanted to take a moment to reflect on my creative process, acknowledge the
    wonderful artists that I have collaborated and worked with on this piece, and articulate the
    improvisational movement work generated.
  </span>
</div>
<br />

### The Beginning Concept

<span>
  Originally, the concept started out as <i>Confidence in Archi-texture</i> which centers around the
  concept of having confidence in building a structure that is only visible to the mind. The
  invisible structure is built through the partnership of music and real-time movement composition.
  With textures in mind, the artist examines what this intangible structure consists of and looks
  like as it goes unseen by the human eye.
</span>
<br />

### Music Intention

<span>
  I had the intent to create the music for this piece as that has been something that I’ve been
  wanting to do ever since I bought the <i>Maschine Mikro MK2</i> back in 2016. Because I hadn’t had
  that much experience with the MIDI machine, I revised the concept to{' '}
  <i>Content in Archi-texture</i> to reflect the current song choice <i>Content</i> by Xander. I
  still wasn’t quite satisfied with the song but felt that it best suited the subject and solidified
  the concept.
</span>
<br />

### The Costume

<div>

  <span>
    With an emphasis on texture, I wanted to wear a top with a hood. I chose a sleeveless grey
    hoodie that had a slight avant-garde vibe and lightweight/breathable fabric. When I have the
    hood on, it gives the sensory experience of comfort. I am able to take a step back from being in
    the present and assess where I currently am and the direction I want to go. To also complement
    the hoodie, I decided to add black leggings and black socks.

### Adjudications

<span>
  On adjudications day for the ASU Fall 2018 Dance Undergrad Show, this is what I presented as my{' '}
  <b>elevator pitch</b> to the Artistic Directors, Taylor and Tori, and{' '}
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ASU-Dance-Undergraduate-Organization-Support-DUOS-277775925582730/">
    ASU DUOS
  </a>{' '}
  (Dance Undergraduate Organization Support):
</span>
<blockquote>
  Content in Archi-texture focuses on the question: What does it mean to be content in the present
  moment? Each person is the physical culmination of the intangible foundation they’ve built for
  themselves. Does being content mean settling? Confronting resistance? Aspiring for more?{' '}
</blockquote>
<span>
  These are all of the questions that I address in my improvisation. In addition, I performed the
  piece in full costume for the sake of professionalism and presentation.
</span>
<span>
  Based on the feedback, the concept was well-received and the piece made it into the Undergrad
  Show! However, both Artistic Directors felt that a different music choice could be considered to
  improve the movement dynamics of the piece as well as match the climax of the journey that I am
  taking the audience on.
</span>

### The Development of <i>Present Shift</i>

<div>
  <img align="right" src="/images/ContentInArchitecture/MaschineMikro.png" />
  <span>
    With only a month to go until the Undergrad Show, I started to explore different music options
    that included the genres of <i>Chillstep</i>, <i>Alternative</i>, and <i>Electronic/Dance</i>.
    In addition, I had been attending Urban Ensemble instructed by Melissa Britt and Sam Wells,
    which is a class that allows the musicians and dancers to collaborate with one another to create
    rhythms via instruments and movement. During one class, we learned House and Chicago footwork
    and experimented with making beats on <i>iMaschine</i> via iPads - little did I know that this
    class would change the course of my piece!
  </span>
  <span>
    Once I got home from that class, I pulled out my <i>Mikro MK2</i> hardware and <i>Maschine 2</i>{' '}
    software on my laptop - all of the buttons on the MK2 now made sense! I started exploring the
    different digital kits available to create a base beat. Next, I started figuring out how to
    create Sections and add in layers of beat patterns. I got so motivated that I created the first
    draft of <i>Present Shift</i> within 3 hours! As I was working toward the final draft, I made
    sure to improvise with each draft to get an idea of what movement rhythms I could generate. I
    ended up adding some elements of House and a slow Samba rhythm into the track. With
    recommendations from my sister, Valerie, to add more rhythms and melodies, I created a final
    draft the next night, uploaded{' '}
    <a href="https://soundcloud.com/courtney-ngai-749460472/present-shift-1">Present Shift</a> on{' '}
    <i>Soundcloud</i>, and sent it to Artistic Directors, Tori and Taylor.
  </span>
  <span>
    Fortunately, I had developed the song right before all of the production needs were finalized.
    The feedback that I received about the song was very positive so I was able to change the
    previously submitted track to the song that I developed! This was definitely a huge
    accomplishment because I have been wanting to create music for the past couple of years to
    complement my movement, and I was finally able to do just that!

### Improvising with <i>Present Shift</i>

<div>
  <img align="right" src="/images/ContentInArchitecture/F18 Undergrad193_edited.jpg" />
  <span>
    With the music decided, I had a couple of improvisation sessions to embody the musicality and
    dynamics before the lighting design meeting and tech week. The beauty of improvisation is that
    you can have the same music, but pull out different elements of the song each time you improvise
    to it. Each time, I gave myself different directives to explore, including: 1) Travel and take
    up more space when highlighting an accent, 2) Incorporate Samba walks and bachacatas, House
    grooving, and even popping, and 3) Create more intricate movement while holding one leg in a
    developpé. I also filmed myself each time to see how the movement actually looked and could be
    perceived by the audience.
  </span>
  <span>
    During one of the improvisation sessions, I had a peer observe and provide feedback from an
    audience perspective. One of the questions that he asked was,
  </span>
  <blockquote>
    “What is the difference between improvising in class and improvisation as a performance?”
  </blockquote>
  <span>
    After some thought, I came to the conclusion that one's focus and how they present themselves to
    those around them produces the difference. For example, whenever I’m improvising in class, I
    notice that my movement becomes more internal and I tend to curve my spine. My focus is downward
    as I am less aware of those around me and more focused on the movement pathways that I am
    discovering. However, when I am improvising for an audience, I make sure to connect with the
    audience. I have more intent with each movement, a stronger focus, and I take up more space with
    my upper body by widening the space between the arms and the torso. The quality of having a
    performance face truly elevates the improvisation and engages the audience on a deeper level
    because you are acknowledging their presence.

### Improvising with <i>Present Shift</i>

  <span>
    During the previous semester, I had one of my best friends, Cheyenne, design the lighting for my
    first solo, <a href="https://youtu.be/a1joxnqzIq4">You Don’t Know Me But You Will</a>, that I
    presented in the ASU Spring '18 Undergraduate Dance Show. The work that she did complemented
    that piece beautifully and I couldn’t think of anyone better suited to light this piece as I
    felt that she understood my improvisational work being a dancer herself. I gave her full control
    over the lighting design appointment. Because the piece is improvisation, she based the lighting
    cues off of the music rather than the movement. Having produced the music, I felt that I was
    able to give her the sensations of the movement to work with which still allowed me the freedom
    to move without being boxed into a single spotlight or one portion of the stage. With the design
    experience, expertise, and ideas that she brought to the table, I am really thankful to have had
    her on board.

### Show Week!

<div>
  <span>
    With improvisational pieces, I place a heavy emphasis on warming up prior to performing. Before
    the tech/dress rehearsals and each show, I gave myself at least an hour to get my muscles warm.
    As a personal movement practice, I start with a ballet barre warm-up before moving to different
    styles such as contemporary, popping, house grooves, and Latin, and even tap. It’s important to
    have the stability and training, as each transition that I make is planned in real-time. As it
    gets closer to performance time, I play the song on repeat to train my brain to memorize the
    different patterns of beats.
  </span>
  <span>
    For Thursday’s performance, I focused more on the intention and sensations of resistance and
    settling. I actually felt more resistance to the choices of my movement and explored that
    feeling throughout the piece. For Friday’s performance, I focused more on the musicality,
    especially the "whooshes" and rhythms of the music, along with aspiring for more by expanding my
    movement beyond my kinesphere.
  </span>

<br />

### Show Week!

<div>
  <span>
    Upon reflection of this piece, I am extremely blessed and grateful to have such a supportive
    group of family and friends, two talented Artistic Directors, a best friend that can do amazing
    lighting/stage managing, a sister and professors for musical composition advice, and a great
    production crew. To hear the applause during the middle of the piece and the loud cheers at the
    end leaves me with a great feeling that keeps me performing. As an artist, I always aim to leave
    a mental footprint i.e. an impression that inspires people to challenge themselves and strive
    for more.
