_Intention_: In honor of my 3 year anniversary at PayPal, I wanted to take a moment and reflect on what I‚Äôve learned in this past career year. This also doubles as a mid-year reflection which is awesome!

<br />

### Lean into your curiosities.

    Last winter, my team collaborated with one of the front end teams to produce the user experience
    for the 3/2 Cashback credit card. It was amazing to see the coordination between what features
    each team implemented and the different entities involved such as legal, product, user
    experience design, front-tier/mid-tier tech leads, etc. While coding the auto pay feature, I
    realized how satisfying it was to create a meaningful experience that customers directly
    interacted with. I now understood the why behind what we've been building. As a result, my
    curiosity grew about the front -tier tech lead and product management roles and as a whole, how
    all of these teams worked together to produce a digital product.

### Build on your existing network.

  />
  This realization of <i>why</i> along with the curiosity of different roles prompted me to transition
  into a full stack software engineering role within PayPal. I did not want to lose the network that
  I had built so far as each person I‚Äôve worked with at PayPal has been so helpful, humble, and multi-talented.
  When I had transferred to my new team in Feb 2022, some of our products called the services owned by
  my previous team. As a result, I still occasionally work with my previous team and I could not have
  been more grateful for the time that I spent collaborating with them as they‚Äôre also a rockstar team
  of engineers!
  <br />
  Another example of building on my existing network was when I re-connected with an engineer who I had
  worked with when I first joined (as I initially started out in the CUE domain and now came back to
  the same domain). I was able to learn about another credit product within the PayPal Credit ecosystem
  from this engineer and exchange about the credit product that I've been working on as well! Overall,
  I‚Äôm quite thankful for the time that each person I‚Äôve worked with has taken to share the knowledge
  that they‚Äôve gathered for the sake of the bigger picture which is working together as one team.

### Push yourself outside your comfort zone.

  Last year, the majority of my work had been in back-end development with the tech stack of Java, Spring,
  and SQL. I had gained experience in the areas of triaging live support issues, working with our DBA
  teams, and creating new endpoints for new/existing micro-services. When reflecting on my 2021 year,
  I realized that my strengths and contributions had mostly been in front-end development. This included
  a collaboration project and our team's internal tool with the tech stack of React, Node, and GraphQL.
  These contributions also felt more rewarding. Now that I had a stronger understanding in the back-end,
  (which I had first deemed as an area of improvement for me) I was ready to capitalize on my strengths
  and do more in the user experience area.
  <br />
  Fast-forward to Feb 2022, during the interview process with other teams, one of the hiring managers
  asked me, ‚ÄúWhat are you interested in working on?‚Äù. This was such a great and meaningful question because
  it prompted me to actualize my interests which are: growth in both software engineering (focusing on
  full stack) and the team I work with, tech leadership, and learning more about the business and product
  requirements that give engineering a strong direction. While interviewing with this same team, I also
  got to exchange with both the Director and Sr. Director, who I currently have monthly 1:1s with, and
  learn more about the direction of the Buy Now Pay Later products. I truly value the flat hierarchy
  of this team especially because not only do we get to learn from each other but we can also tackle
  the problems that happen at the ground-level and create solutions that can benefit all of the teams
  within the org.

<br />

### The importance of mentorship.

<div>
  <img align="right" src="/images/3Year/Chicago Women's Park & Garden Fountain.jpg" />
  I find 1:1s so valuable because it‚Äôs dedicated time where you get to exchange with and learn from another
  human who comes from a different background, different/similar experiences, and different/same career.
  My team also places an emphasis on diversity and growing women in tech (which I truly appreciate!).
  In these past six months, I‚Äôve been connecting with leaders from areas such as Program Management,
  Product Management, and Analytics Management. Within the area of Program Management, I‚Äôve gotten to
  learn more about the orchestration of people, tasks, and projects along with what it takes to plan,
  execute, and host a virtual 3-day global conference for recent college graduates. Within Product Management,
  I‚Äôve learned about the AARM Method‚Ñ¢ as well as the Product Development Lifecycle phases. Within Analytics
  Management, I‚Äôve learned about auditing and merchant pricing analytics. I‚Äôve also gotten to learn from
  my teammates in terms of standardizing CSS padding/margin, maintaining the focus of what we‚Äôre building
  so that we don‚Äôt create waste, and how merchants work with our teams to offer Buy Now Pay Later products.
  <br />
  An additional tip that I've learned about mentorship is asking my mentors, "Is there anything that
  you feel I could help with?" This question has allowed me to also be a resource for them that they
  can count on. By understanding what issues that my mentors face, I can also help as a sounding board.
  I've also kept these issues in mind in case I can help play a part from either a peer, individual contributor,
  or tech lead perspective.

### Give back and in turn, receive an abundance.

  In addition to having wonderful mentors, it's just as important to give back as a peer-to-peer mentor
  because you can achieve great heights in your career AND create success for others along the way. We've
  been looking to expand our team and I got the opportunity to conduct technical interviews. Each interview
  has been different and I've learned that there's so many different solutions to one problem - which
  is fascinating! I've been able to gain insight into how different engineers think based on their experiences.
  I've also been able to understand the importance of software engineering fundamentals and how peer
  programming can provide a sense of teamwork.
  <br />A moment that stood out to me was when a candidate was blanking on how to answer the
  question. Instead of ending the interview there, I saw this as an opportunity to help the
  candidate gain more by sharing my thought-process (which is what we ask of the candidates). I
  asked the candidate, "Would you be open to walking through a potential solution of the question?"
  to which they replied "Yes, please!". As a result, the candidate was very appreciative and open to
  both advice and feedback. I even learned more about my thought-process and about where a candidate
  can get stuck implementation-wise. In addition to interviewing, this summer, I have had the honor
  of taking on 3 interns who are in the areas of Marketing Strategy, Compliance Platform, and Fraud
  Risk as part of PayPal's Recent Graduate/Intern buddy program. Each intern has come from a varied
  background ranging from business to software engineering and from a rising Sophomore to pursuing a
  Master's with a couple years of industry experience. I've also had 1:1s with other interns who
  have reached out from LinkedIn, I've worked with last summer, or who are on my team. I'm able to
  learn from them just as much as they are able to learn from me.

  There were a few days in these past couple months where I had done a bit of everything that I had learned
  over the course of 3 years. On a Monday, just after a long weekend thanks to a Wellness Day, I worked
  with a new hire to request admin access (Onboarding ‚úîÔ∏è). Next, I helped configure financing options
  for a test credit merchant with a teammate from my previous team (Working with financial micro-services
  ‚úîÔ∏è). This configuration was also done via the internal credit admin tool (Internship project ‚úîÔ∏è). Afterwards,
  I planned a fun CodeNames event with my talented Recent Graduate committee members (Recent College
  Graduate ‚úîÔ∏è). Lastly, to complete the work day, I wrote unit tests for a feature within our internal
  offer configuration tool (Full stack software engineering ‚úîÔ∏è).

## Summary

<div>

  When reflecting on my 3rd year at PayPal, I'm grateful that I get to work with such phenomenal team
  members, have such supportive people managers (both past and present!), and have an abundance of mentors.
  I'm incredibly thankful for the different opportunities that allow you to grow in numerous areas such
  as engineering, business, and leadership. I tend to think about the different paths I could have taken
  and realize that this transition was meant to be as I'm able to expand my existing network and build
  upon the previous knowledge that I've gained in both the PayPal-ecosystem and software engineering
  in general. I still have so much to learn and I'm excited to see how this journey continues.
