  <i>Intention</i>: I wanted to take the time to document and reflect on the TigerGraph Hackathon
  that was held virtually. I also thought it’d be fun to do this in a Q&A format!
</span>
<br />

## What is TigerGraph?

<blockquote>
  TigerGraph is the world’s fastest graph analytics platform designed to unleash the power of
  interconnected data for deeper insights and better outcomes. TigerGraph fulfills the true promise
  and benefits of the graph platform by tackling the toughest data challenges in real time, no
  matter how large or complex the dataset.

### Our Solution

<div>
  <span>
    As recent as 2015, FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) has provided more match data through their
    API and thus allowed teams to gather and analyze this data. In addition, other independent
    organizations like The Blue Alliance have created a website and app for teams to make this data
    more accessible. Our team decided to try our hand in analyzing this data, experimenting with the
    Tiger Graph Cloud, and developing a dashboard with Plotly Dash.

## Let's dive into the Q&A!

<blockquote>How did you hear about the TigerGraph Hackathon?</blockquote>

<span>
  It was the beginning of July, on a Friday evening and I got a group text from my second-cousin,
  Christian, asking if I’d be interested in participating in the TigerGraph Hackathon with him and
  any of his friends who were also interested. I actually hadn’t done a hackathon before! I thought
  this was a great way to dive into the hackathon/solution-building world. Plus, with this hackathon
  also being held virtually with the submission deadline being 2 months away, I was able to dedicate
  the off-work hours needed for this project.
</span>

<br />

<blockquote>What was it like working on a fully remote team?</blockquote>

<span>
  Team-wise, there were about six of us who all have a full time job in the fields of Software
  Engineering, Database Management, and Machine Learning. Due to Covid, we were all working from
  home starting around May so this hackathon definitely felt like a side-project with a set
  deadline. For communications, we created a Discord channel and met once a week every Saturday. On
  Discord, we were able to upload any files that we had as well share our screens to demo during our
  weekly meetups. Only one team member was based in the east coast so we just had to be mindful of
  the time difference when setting the meetings up.
</span>

<br />

<blockquote>What was the process like considering the TigerGraph Hackathon was virtual?</blockquote>

<span>
  With the hackathon being virtual and over 2 months, that gave us just enough time to brainstorm
  how we wanted to showcase the TigerGraph software. During the first two weeks, we discussed
  possible solutions and eventually settled on using the Blue Alliance data as that's what a few of
  our team members were already familiar with. We used GitHub project to outline the tasks that
  needed to be done for the features that we wanted. We also split our team into two teams: back-end
  (3 people) and front-end (2 people). The back-end team focused on loading the Blue Alliance data
  into the TigerGraph data model while the front-end team focused on the statistical functions and
  the GUI (Graphical User Interface).
</span>

<br />

<blockquote>What was your role on the team?</blockquote>

<span>
  I worked on the back-end team helping with the TigerGraph schema and loading job setup. Having
  some experience with Agile development, I took it upon myself to be the Project Manager for the
  back-end and add a majority of the tasks needed to get the TigerGraph schema uploaded onto the
  TigerGraph server. At the end, I also created the demo video via Final Cut Pro and the team helped
  create the scripting for the video.
</span>

<br />

<blockquote>What are your personal takeaways from this project?</blockquote>

<span>
  One takeaway is that I gained more leadership experience being the Project Manager for the
  back-end. Even though I started off creating the TigerGraph schema (graph model of the data), we
  still had to get that schema to the server, load the data which we had to edit parts of that data,
  and make sure our TigerGraph server was running. Since we all haven't worked with TigerGraph
  software before, there were a lot of unknowns that had to be fleshed out and addressed so
  definitely having more hands on deck helped. For example, there was a point where we were working
  two days before the extended submission deadline and we still hadn't gotten the schema to our
  server. One person was working on it but unfortunately, their computer kept crashing when trying
  to upload the schema. I made the call to get all back-end hands on deck and another team member
  was able to get the schema to our TigerGraph server.
  <br />
  Another takeaway is that it was helpful to have actionable tasks for members to work on. The
  quicker we started outlining the tasks, the sooner we were able to start working and even find out
  the unknowns/uncertainties that came with the implementation aspect.
</span>

<br />

<blockquote>What are the team takeaways from this project?</blockquote>

<span>
  After the submission deadline, the team gathered for a quick retro. We outlined that it would
  useful to have the requirements outlined earlier and it would be useful to add a quick 15-minute
  Scrum meeting during the week. In addition, it would also be useful to create a Project timeline
  or Gantt chart just to make more space for testing since we weren't able to get to that. Being on
  the back-end team, we felt that 3 people was a good amount and so hearing the front-end team's
  thoughts, they would have also benefited from having another person as well to bring them to 3
  team members. Upon reflection, this also reminds me of{' '}
  <a href="http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/Miller-s-Law.html">Miller's Law</a> where a
  person can retain or process only 7 ±2 chunks of information in serial order. With this in mind, I
  think that having a team of 6-7 people would probably be the most optimal in terms of holding a
  conversation and processing each person's input.{' '}

<br />

## Wrap-Up

<span>
  Overall, it was great working with a team who are full of determination and grit and was willing
  to jump in whenever asked. We were also grateful that the submission deadline got extended
  otherwise we wouldn't have been able to submit our solution.
