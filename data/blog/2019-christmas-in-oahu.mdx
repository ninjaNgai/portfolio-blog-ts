  Picture the middle of October and my family sitting around the dinner table. My sister, Valerie,
  asks,
  <br />
  "Are we thinking about going anywhere for Christmas?"
  <br />
  "Yeah, Disneyland!" I replied. Well I thought this was a great idea since we went to DisneyWorld
  last Christmas and enjoyed seeing all of the wonderful Christmas decorations. To my surprise,
  Valerie responds
  <br />
  "I'm kind of tired of going to Disneyland, could we go somewhere else? I really want to go
  hiking..."
  <br />
  <br />
  In the compromise of finding a destination that we would all enjoy for Christmas along with going somewhere
  that wasn't super cold, we collectively decided on O'ahu, Hawaii. There were hiking trails for Valerie
  along with beaches, tourist places, and food for me to check out. My parents had been there a few decades
  ago and also didn't mind re-visiting since there were beaches to relax on.

### Transportation & Lodging

<span>
  We booked our flights via <a href="https://www.hawaiianairlines.com/">Hawaiian Airlines</a>. We
  also booked via AirBnB at the{' '}
  <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/633314?source_impression_id=p3_1578355733_dKVXECuAeof5vyZm">
    Tropical Studios at Marine Surf Waikiki
  </a>
  . The studio was about 10 mins of Waikiki beach which was the perfect location as everything was within
  walking distance. In addition, we rented a car from <a href="https://www.cngai.info/post/2019-christmas-in-o-ahu#:~:text=a%20car%20from-,Hertz,-to%20drive%20around">
    Hertz
  </a> to drive around the island.{' '}
</span>
<br />

### Food

<span>
  Being a big foodie, I wanted to try out all of the good spots on Oahu while also find some hidden
  gems to share on{' '}
  <a href="https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=sxAqe5Ae24sc-ZvJgPKuCg">Yelp</a>. My sister's
  friend, John, a local and a foodie, gave us a huge list of food that he's enjoyed on the island
  along with places to try. We compiled them onto Google Maps and added the places that we've been
  to as well. Click here for the link: <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/QCn6t5UCA28NZ8k88">Oahu Eats</a>
</span>
<br />

## Day 1

<span>
  For breakfast, we tried the local platter of pork sausage, spam, eggs, rice at the McDonald's in
  Waikiki. According to John, it was special. In my opinion, this was definitely a meal to try while
  you're here!
</span>
<br />

### Diamond Head Crater Trail

<div>
  <img align="right" src="/images/Oahu/Diamondhead.jpg" />
  <span>
    There were a limited amount of parking spots at the trail so we ended up parking about a mile
    away at a nearby church that offered free parking. As we were walking up to the start of the
    trail, there was this vast grass land that was beautiful to gaze at. Along the hike, the trail
    was more spacious up until the stairs to go to the highest point.
  </span>

<br />

### Dole Whip @Honolulu Pineapple Co

<div>
  <img align="right" src="/images/Oahu/HonoluluPineapple.jpg" />
  <span>
    At the end of the trail there was the <i>Honolulu Pineapple Co</i> truck. We ordered pineapple
    slices which were so juicy and cold and Dole pineapple whip which made my mouth water. To eat
    Dole pineapple whip after a hike was so refreshing. The whip was better than the Dole whip in
    DisneyLand!
  </span>
  <span>
    After our hike, we checked out Lanikai Beach. It was really windy so we enjoyed sitting on the
    white sand and ate Maui Onion chips. These chips are my favorite thing to get when I'm in
    Hawaii!
  </span>
</div>

## Day 2

<span>
  We started the day of with some musubi and Bento boxes from{' '}
  <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/musubi-and-bento-iyasume-honolulu?hrid=DGqfOhEJq22Ii0fjBiATWQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)">
    Musubi & Bento IYASUME
  </a>
  , a local business. We came across this place while walking along the International Market Place. While
  all of them looked good and fresh, I went with the Bento Box with Salmon. The fish was tasty and I
  enjoyed the calamari tempura. The oyster sauce with vegetables was also a good combo. I tried the spam
  musubi and it was bursting with flavor. This is great for grabbing a quick bite on the way to Sunset
  beach.
</span>
<span>
  At Sunset beach, we were able to find parking fairly quickly and enjoy the waves for a couple of
  hours. We got hungry so we went to Romy's Prawn & Shrimp Hut. They were pretty packed so due to
  our time constraint of needing to eat within around 45 mins, we ordered a 1/2 lb shrimp + Butter &
  Garlic Sauteed sauce. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious with the sauce. The
  rice was filler yet also tasted good with the sauce.
</span>
<br />

### CLIMB Works Zip-line

<div>
  <img align="right" src="/images/Oahu/Zipline.jpg" />
  <span>
    At the beginning of this trip, my sister and I wanted to do something that we wouldn't get to do
    otherwise and splurge a little bit as well. Zip-lining has always been in the back of my mind
    and so I suggested it to Valerie and we found a place,{' '}
    <a href="https://www.climbworks.com/keana_farms/">CLIMB Works</a> that we could book within the
    next couple of days despite the holiday week. I definitely had some anxiety about the heights
    but I wanted to push and challenge myself mentally.
  </span>
  <span>
    We arrived at the place and since our parents weren't zip-lining, they were able to watch our
    belongings and we put our phones in the lockers. We signed the waivers and were put in a group.
    We started off with a trial run and then we took an 10-min ATV to the next zipline. As we went
    through each zipline, I had more and more fun AND didn't mind how high off of the ground we were
    because the views were BREATHTAKING! I was definitely nervous about flying over 150 feet in the
    air. By the end of this course, I was flying upside down Hawaii Spider-Man-style!
  </span>
  <blockquote>
    Cost: $169 per person. $45 for all photos taken throughout the course - which were definitely
    worth it!
  </blockquote>
  <span>
    Afterwards, we continued with our ramen spree and tried Ramen Bario at the Japanese Food Court
    in Waikiki. Upon seeing all of the great reviews, my family just had to see what this place is
    all about. I got the Egg ramen and was pleasantly satisfied. The broth is super rich. The
    noodles are thick. The egg was cooked just right. The bean sprouts were super fresh. The char
    siu fell apart to enjoy the delicious flavor. The wait was about 20-30 mins due to the small
    size of the place but it was well worth it.
  </span>
  <blockquote>Note: Cash only.</blockquote>

## Day 3

<div>
  <img align="right" src="/images/Oahu/Udon.jpg" />
  <span>
    Since our AirBnB was in Waikiki, we'd often walk along this restaurant, Marukame Udon, that had
    at least an hour long wait and a long line. To avoid the line, we came around 10:30am to only
    wait 20 mins. The staff is very fast at producing your order. Service is quite minimal. Despite
    the crowd, we were actually able to find a table to sit at. This is what I tried: Nikutama Udon,
    Shrimp Tempura, Potato Tempura, and Spam Musubi. The Nikutama Udon noodles were chewy yet firm
    on the inside giving the noodles a homemade feel. The broth was salty and tasty. I added green
    onions and tempura flakes. This place is worth the wait!
  </span>
  <br />
  <span>
    We went to the Ali'i Beach Park and relaxed for a few hours. We had a photoshoot for fun and got
    to watch a bunch of little snails in their natural habitat. Afterwards, we got Matsumoto Shaved
    Ice at the original location in Haleiwa. This place was recommended by my friend who's a local
    so we just had to check this location out! We came around 5pm and there was a 5-10 min line. I
    got a small Green River (Lemon/Lime), Ramune (Japanese soda), Lilikoi shave ice with vanilla ice
    cream. It's everything that you would want from a shave ice! They even give you a straw to sip
    the syrupy goodness at the end!
  </span>
  <br />
  <span>
    For dinner, we walked to Sura Hawaii for Korean BBQ, also recommended by my sister's local
    friend. I've never had Korean BBQ before so it was a fun experience to cook our own meat.
    There's also a valet service $4.00 to have your car parked. At this "All You Can Eat" Meat &
    Seafood BBQ, we tried shrimp, scallops, premium steak, premium sliced beef brisket, marinated
    boneless kalbi, and brisket Bulgogi. For the house specialties, we tried Beef bulgogi, garlic
    shrimp bibimbap, fried noodles, and non spicy tofu w/ seafood soup. My favorites of the meat
    were the premium steak, marinated boneless kalbi, and shrimp. My favorites of the house
    specialties are the beef Bulgogi and the shrimp bibimbap.

## Day 4 - Christmas!

<div>
  <img align="right" src="/images/Oahu/LighthouseTrail.jpg" />
  <span>
    Continuing our ramen spree, we reserved a spot at <i>Volcano Ramen</i> in the Yokocho food hall
    and got <i>Nana's Green Tea</i> while we were waiting for our reservation to come up. I came
    across Nana's Green Tea in the Japanese Food Hall and was lured in by all of the pictures. I
    decided to try the hot Matcha Chocolate Latte. The flavor of matcha was lighter than expected
    yet it mixed well with the chocolate. I really enjoyed this drink and sipped it while we were
    waiting for our ramen. We ordered the classic Tonkotsu ramen which they title <i>Kazan Ramen</i>
    . They bring the stone bowl out for you - pour the soup into it and close it with a red triangle
    lid. After 1 minute of simmering and cooking - the Kazan Ramen is ready.
  </span>
  <br />
  <span>
    We went hiking at <i>Makapu'u Point Lighthouse Trail</i>. The path was so wide that you could
    drive a car up which made this trail wheel-chair friendly as well. It is about 2-3 miles long
    which makes for about an hour or so if you stay at the top to take photos. Despite the mist, I
    enjoyed the views along the way.
  </span>
  <br />
  <span>
    Since it was Christmas Day, we wanted to try another place in Waikiki so we reserved a spot at
    the <i>Genius Lounge</i> the day before thanks to OpenTable! We came right at opening time and
    loved the choices available. I got to try the Fish & Chips, Garlic Ahi Steak, Furikake Ahi
    Steak, Grilled Short Rib w/ Hawaiian BBQ Sauce, Loco Moco, Aloha Tower Parfait, and Hawaiian
    Chocolate Brownie. Each dish was bursting with unique, delicious flavor and the portions were on
    the smaller side. My favorites were the ahi steaks, short rib, loco moco, and Aloha Tower
    parfait.
  </span>

## Day 5

### Shopping at Ala Moana Center

<div>
  <img align="right" src="/images/Oahu/BalenciagaStore.jpg" />
  <span>
    With all of the shopping places in Waikiki, we wanted to check out the Ala Moana Center, known
    as <i>Ala Moana</i>, since it's the largest open-air shopping center in the world. We got udon
    and these cute Hello Kitty Puffs at Kulu Kulu. Afterwards, I was on a hunt for cool designer
    sock runners so we went looked at Ferragamo, Armani Exchange, and Louis Vuitton before heading
    to Balenciaga since I reserved a pair of sock runners there. It's been a dream of mine to own a
    pair of the Balenciaga Sock runners and so it was time to speak this into reality! I tried on
    the Balenciaga Speed Graffiti Trainers Black White and absolutely loved how comfy they are! I'm
    a size 7 but ended up getting a size 9 because they didn't have them in a size 8 and it wasn't
    that much of a jump. The store provided some water bottles and the nice assistant also had me
    try on some windbreakers that paired well with the shoes. I also got a bracelet from Swarovski
    and makeup brushes from Sephora and Morphe. For dinner, we got ramen in the Shirokiya Japan
    Village Walk. It was so cool to checkout the different restaurants. On the way back to our
    AirBnB, I got a snow globe from the Tiki place inside the Japanese Food Hall. I also saw that
    there was a bubble tea place with unicorns so I just had to check the Unicorn Cafe out. I got a
    Lanikai Lemonade (Passion fruit) with rainbow jelly. The drink was delicious for a hotter humid
    evening.
  </span>
  <br />
  <span>
    We went hiking at <i>Makapu'u Point Lighthouse Trail</i>. The path was so wide that you could
    drive a car up which made this trail wheel-chair friendly as well. It is about 2-3 miles long
    which makes for about an hour or so if you stay at the top to take photos. Despite the mist, I
    enjoyed the views along the way.

## Wrap Up

<span>
  As a wrap-up, this Christmas was relaxing even while hiking and we enjoyed so many delicious
  foods. I even conquered my fear of heights after zip-lining and can't wait to go zip-lining in
  another state/country. Thanks for reading and Mahalo!
