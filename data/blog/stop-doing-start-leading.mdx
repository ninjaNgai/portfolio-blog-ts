<span>
  <i>Intention</i>: I want to take a moment to reflect on the impact the Dale Carnegie{' '}
  <i>Develop Your Leadership Potential: Stop Doing, Start Leading</i> course has made on my
  professional career. I really enjoyed what I had learned from the first Dale Carnegie course and
  saw growth in my public speaking, networking, and confidence with the tools that I had gained. The
  Dale Carnegie <i>Develop Your Leadership Potential</i> course builds on top of the foundations
  created from the Dale Carnegie human relations skills course and looks at Human Relations in a
  systemic way. When I find out (actually less than a week before this course started!) that this
  leadership course was being offered and was 100% reimbursed by PayPal’s educational assistance
  program, I signed up as fast as I could.
</span>
<br />

## Setup

<span>
  The Dale Carnegie Leadership Course was held online via Cisco WebEx every Wednesday from
  3:00-5:30pm for 8 weeks. Especially during the pandemic, I’ve found that it’s important to have
  your camera on so I also had a ring light behind the camera to improve my virtual presence. I also
  found that it was helpful to have a standing desk to project and give more energy when speaking.

  <span>
    I came in with the mentality that I eventually want to be a leader. Since I’m not in a
    management position, I want to prepare the best that I can for a leadership opportunity. I came
    in with this mindset but then I ultimately needed to change my mindset because I saw this slide
    with the phrase:
  </span>
  <blockquote>Stop doing, start leading</blockquote>
  <span>
    This gave me an “Aha” moment where I realized that I needed to switch from being an aspiring
    leader to actually seeing myself as a leader and act as a leader.
  </span>
  <br />
  <span>
    Continue to develop your strengths because that’s what keeps you set apart from the rest. With
    these strengths, you can also transfer the knowledge and make stronger connections with the
    competencies that need to be improved.

## Week 2

<blockquote>
  “People with integrity do what they say they are going to do. Others have excuses.” ―Laura
  Schlessinger
</blockquote>
<span>
  During this week’s session, we discussed creating a plan of how we’re going to make an impact as a
  leader. What stuck out to me in this session is,
</span>
<blockquote>How can we make the small talk more intentional?</blockquote>

<div>
  <span>
    To me, I generally don’t mind small talk because my perspective is that the small talk sets the
    foundation of the relationship between you and another person. As we dive deeper into this,
    there are three different types of questions that you can ask depending on how much trust you’ve
    established with that other person.
  </span>
  <ol>
    <li>
      The first type is <b>fact-based</b> questions. This allows the other party to share how much
      they’d like to without feeling completely vulnerable.
    </li>
    <li>
      The second type are the <b>causative-based</b> questions to dive deeper into what caused the
      person to make the choices that they did in reference to the facts that they shared.
    </li>
    <li>
      The third type and the deepest level in terms of vulnerability are the <b>value-based</b>{' '}
      questions.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <span>
    Especially during quarantine, the distancing makes it harder for us to connect with others and
    even talk face-to-face with others, depending on each individual’s situation.{' '}
  </span>
</div>

<br />

### Get Comfortable With Asking These Questions

<div>
  <span>
    At the beginning of this week, I reached out to a new hire who recently joined our team to be
    another point of contact and also just see if they had any questions that I could help answer as
    they joined during this fully-remote time. This meetup was a great opportunity to be able to get
    more comfortable with asking these factual based questions. During this session, I also got to
    share about our fun culture that we have and just how our organization is truly a flat-hierarchy
    because the whole team and sub-teams are very approachable.

  <span>
    This week, we did more impromptu speakings about how we are forming our Leadership Impact plan.
    We shared our thought process as well as a time where we had to develop ourselves or another
    person. Due to internship and job hunts starting up over the Summer and Fall, I've been on the
    panel of a couple of <i>Ask Me Anything</i> events. These events have allowed me to speak to
    over 300+ students and I've also been able to connect with a handful of students over LinkedIn
    and Zoom calls. One of the most frequently asked questions that I've gotten is
  </span>
  <blockquote>What is the transition like from doing internship to working full time?</blockquote>
  <span>
    What stood out to me as part of the transition is just how much you become integrated into and
    immersed in the company's culture. Rather than working on one project, you're working on
    multiple projects and interacting with other teams within your organization. I found that when
    we switched to being fully remote, there were areas for our organization to grow in terms of fun
    ways for everyone to virtually come together. I also realized that for new hires, they don't get
    to see the culture of our organization. This led me to come up a with a plan that centers
    around,{' '}
    <i>
      How can we engage our new hires in our organization's culture and make them feel included now
      that we have moved to a virtual space?
    </i>
  </span>

## Week 4

<span>
  This week we focused on giving feedback and specifically cushioning any constructive feedback that
  could cause conflicts. What I took away from this session is that it’s important to practice with
  different scenarios and it’s helpful to have a coach who can give you encouragement and
  suggestions. We each took turns being the person doing the conflict resolution, the person
  receiving the feedback, and the coach. We were each given challenging scenarios that really pushed
  us to think creatively about our responses and brainstorm together how we can improve our
  feedback. By there only being four of us in the course, I felt like we were really able to dive
  into the content and have more time to collaborate. Over the past few weeks, we’ve created a space
  that has allowed us to be more vulnerable yet learn because we’re all so eager to immediately
  start applying what we’ve been learning.
</span>
<blockquote>I see what you’re saying about this situation. Could you please expand?</blockquote>

<br />

## Week 5

<span>
  In this session, we focused on conflict resolution. I got to share about a time where during a
  code review, I and another team member has different views on how the code should be split into
  different layers due to the business logic. While both of our opinions were valid, we also each
  had use cases. Since I did feel strongly about my opinion, it wasn’t as easy for me to just accept
  my teammate’s suggestions. I decided to take a step back and brainstormed on how to resolve this
  because we could easily go back and forth. I made sure to communicate that I see my teammate’s
  points and when I presented my thoughts, I asked for theirs as well. In the end, I suggested a
  compromise that we were both cool with.
</span>
<blockquote>
  Moving forward, it’s important to find a common ground between you and the other party.{' '}
</blockquote>

<br />

## Week 6

<span>
  In this session, we focused on improving our self-awareness as leaders to avoid potential
  blind-spots. In August, I received a book for my birthday titled{' '}
  <i>
    Insight : The Surprising Truth about How Others See Us, How We See Ourselves, and Why the
    Answers Matter More Than We Think
  </i>{' '}
  by Tasha Eurich. I felt that this book and the feed-forward tool that was shared in this session
  connect on the same theme: taking a proactive approach to improving your awareness, both
  internally and externally. In this session, we got to split into two groups and share a trait that
  we've noticed in ourselves that we're looking to improve upon. For me, I find that I tend to take
  critiques more personally and am working on changing that perspective to the other person wants me
  to succeed because this is also my intention when giving feedback and suggestions. In a
  feed-forward approach, my cohort-mate Julie, gave me some really great advice to{' '}
  <b>believe in myself and trust the process as well as the advice that is shared.</b>
</span>

<br />

## Week 7

<img width="740" height="342" src="/images/StartLeading/Garden_doors.png" />

<span>
  This session focused on self-regulation in the time of a crisis and actively listening. We did an
  exercise where we had to listen to a time where one of our cohort felt like they weren't being
  listened to, summarize what they said and any shared previously, and then share a time that we
  also felt like we weren't being heard. Normally with learning dance combinations, we have a lot of
  repetition so in case you don't hear/see it the first time, most likely, they'll repeat it again.
  In this case, we only heard it once which was difficult for me. This is definitely an area that I
  can improve upon as we have our daily standup meetings and it's important to hear each team
  member's update. At the end of this session, I had the opportunity to give the closing speech. I
  decided to share a story that was quite relevant because of its connection to self-regulating in a
  multiple crises.
</span>
<blockquote>
  Let me take you back to this Sunday night. We’re getting our house re-painted so we moved all of
  the furniture to the middle of the room, our work desks to two bedrooms that weren’t getting
  re-painted, and portioned our lunches out for the next couple of days. On Day 1 of 3, I’m working
  in my bedroom, quickly make my sandwich, and keep on working. I'm also on Live Support for our
  team's credit micro-services which means that I would need to be available for any service
  triaging or adhoc requests that come up during the work day. I come out of my bedroom around 5:30
  PM and everything that could possibly get paint on it, is covered in cellophane and tape. The
  stairs, closets where our clothes were, pantry, and even the toilet, was covered! On top of that,
  the painters tell us, “We’ll need you all to be out of the house since we’ll be spray-painting.”
  In prep for Day 2, we quickly had to move our work desks to the garage and brave going to In N Out
  for food and restrooms. In between Day 1 and 2, the house was covered in cellophane but nothing
  had been painted yet. My sister and I took this as an opportunity to create some dance films in
  the shower, master bathroom sink, garden doors, and even the space around the entertainment center
  that was wrapped in cellophane. We also brought out my photography lights that I’ve been using for
  filming to set the mood and also control the lighting. This moment made me realize that it’s
  important to take the time to process. We could have focused on the inconveniences but instead we
  turned this into art. With this, I encourage each of you to allow yourself the time to process and
  live in the present - thank you!
</blockquote>

<br />

## Week 8

<span>
  This was our last of the sessions and the feeling was bitter-sweet. It felt like these weeks went
  by so quickly and I enjoyed every single session. We learned a powerful tool where you can
  categorize what you’ve already done vs what’s currently in your head. It was wonderful to sort out
  what’s in-progress vs accomplished in my leadership plan and get the cohort’s suggestions and
  advice on how to proceed further with what’s in-progress. This exercise was a great for
  collaboration and brainstorming because each member had such unique solutions and advice.
</span>
<br />

## TLDR; Wrap Up

<span>
  I really enjoyed this experience and felt that there were a lot of great conversations that took
  place between the classmates and Cayly, our facilitator. Cayly did a wonderful job of facilitating
  these conversations and in sharing her personal examples. She also gave us great feedforward when
  we shared our stories. She played such a monumental role in helping us move out of our comfort
  zone and shine in the breakthrough zone while growing and refining our leadership skills! In
  addition, there were only 4 of us which made the discussions more diverse and fruitful - each
  person got to speak up and jump in whenever we wanted to add to the conversation. We fast-tracked
  our Leadership Plan by Week 4 and actually got to start putting it into motion. I felt that by
  being able to apply the leadership tools that we learned each week such as active listening and
  communication, giving feedforward, and self-awareness insights,
</span>
<blockquote>
  <b>
    I made the switch during the 8 sessions and actually started seeing myself as a leader rather
    than training to be one.
  </b>

  Thank you for taking the time to read and hope that you benefit from these takeaways as well!
