  For the July 4th holiday weekend, my family and I decided to change it up and travel again before
  I started working. When choosing a place to go, it was a no brainer to choose San Francisco since
  we wanted to visit our great-aunt and uncle who aren’t really related to us however, we think of
  them as family due to my grandfather and great aunt having grown up in the same village in Hong
  Kong. For July 4th, we got to have dim sum at Imperial Garden Seafood Restaurant.

### The Importance of Family

  We visited our great-aunt and great-uncle each day we were here - three days total. Since we just
  came back from Europe, they showed us the photos of when they went also. It was wonderful sharing
  stories of travel and lifestyle 30 years ago. It is so inspiring to see how healthy and energetic
  they still are.

### Japantown

    On the second day, we checked out Japantown. The first thing we saw was Peace Plaza. I couldn’t
    help but admire the structure of the Peace Pagoda. I also danced in it as my way of showing
    respect, channeling the emotions I currently felt, and exploring what it was like to be inside
    the pagoda. I felt alive being immersed in and learning more about the Japanese culture. Having
    such a close friend who is Japanese American and hearing about her talk about the legacy that
    the older generation of Japanese Americans are leaving as well as the struggles of injustices
    for Japanese Americans has helped me feel more connected. We also checked out the shops in
    Japanese Center and ate some delicious House Ramen at Hinodeya Ramen Bar.

### Chinatown

  On our last day, we went to Chinatown as it was an easy 10 min walk from the hotel where we were
  staying at in Downtown San Francisco. While we were walking around, I felt a sense of the Chinese
  market that we have in Phoenix, but in a much grander scale. The feeling of becoming more curious
  about my own culture has grown larger ever since I’ve lived with my grandmother and have seen the
  cultural differences. I feel that it is a birthright to carry on what previous generations have
  set.
